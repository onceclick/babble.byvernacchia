A few weeks ago, a co-worker and I had the opportunity to speak at [Node on the Road][1]; Presented by [Joyent][2]. We traveled all the way from Indianapolis to Cincinnati. Long trip (/s), especially the ride back after hanging out with the [Modulus][5] team when all the presentations had finished.

Our presentation covered:

1. How [ExactTarget][4] uses Node.js
2. What challenges we face
3. What we are doing to fix those challenges
4. The future of Node.js at ExactTarget

Unfortunately I cannot embed [our presentation][3] on my site, but Joyent has it on their site.

After watching the video I will be working hard to improve my public speaking skills (I'm the one on the right), mainly by talking less with my hands. Overall, I thought it went pretty well. Any feedback is welcome, as always.
