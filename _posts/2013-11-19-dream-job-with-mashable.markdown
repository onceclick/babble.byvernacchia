[Mashable][1] held a dream job contest last month. I figured I'd enter just to see what it was about. After applying I totally forgot about entering, but a month later I was greeted with a message in my inbox saying I was selected as a winner. 1 out of 500 people. How cool is that?

The only catch was that I had to get to NYC myself. Problem? No way. I like my job too much, so I had a lot of vacation time lying around that I would lose if I didn't use. "Is it true that if you don't use it, you lose it?" (40-Year-Old Virgin). In this case, yes. So I decided to use it, and now I'm off to NYC!

**TL;DR** - I got to tour Mashable, Stack Overflow, Facebook, Tumblr, and Spotify when I visited NYC. It was fucking awesome in so many ways.

##NYC Uncubed by Wakefield

Part of winning this contest allowed me to go to [NYC Uncubed][2] for free. It was a start-up aficionado's wet dream. There were panels given by successful start-up founders/engineers, in addition to all of the companies at the job fair were start-ups. Most of which had just gotten their funding (or were extremely close to it).

It was a great event to attend. I stepped outside at one point and noticed the line was around the corner (and this place was in the middle of the block).

Some of the companies there were doing cool things, but in the end I ended up talking to most of them about the company I work for. You know, because we are doing much cooler stuff with better technology. ExactTarget was once in same situation of many of the start-ups I talked to, and I bet a good amount of them will do huge things.

Even though I wasn't looking for a job, I ended up talking to a lot of recruiters. I think they liked how I broke the ice answering their initial questions of, "Why are you here?" or "What are you looking for?" My answer was either, "Shits and giggles" or "Because I didn't have to pay."

It was definitely a cool experience, and I'm glad that I went. I even formed some new relationships with different companies just in case I end up looking for a different opportunity down the road.

##Seeing My Dream Up Close

The second part, and arguably the coolest, part of Mashable's Dream Job Contest was getting to tour the NYC offices of Mashable, Stack Overflow, Facebook, Tumblr, and Spotify. We even got Uber credit so we didn't have to pay for transportation. Sick right?!?

###Mashable

The first stop on our tour was Mashable, whose office is on the corner of 18th and Park (if I remember correctly [IIRC]). One of the first pictures we took on our journey was us trying to spell "Mashable." We were missing a few, but we tried. And yes it says, "cheers bitches" in the background.

My first impression was a cozy, mid-sized office, for NYC, but I loved the open floor layout where all the editors were situated. It screamed collaboration, which I feel is an essential aspect of writing.

After walking around a little more, it seemed like they were growing and didn't know where to put people. The same thing is happening with us, so I knew exactly what was happening when I was 4-5 desks in one office. The joys of growth haha.

We met one editor who enlightened us about [Grumpy Cat][3]. She wrote the water cooler section, so it figures. Just messing. It was actually pretty cool because they got Sesame Street to do a video with Grumpy Cat, which they showed us as well.

###Stack Overflow

If you're a nerd you know what Stack Overflow is. If not, [catch up][4].

Their office is in the financial district, all the way at the bottom of Manhattan. I would never have guessed. It just doesn't seem right for a start-up. Shouldn't banks be screwing people over there?

I digress. The office was kick-ass. The view, unbelievable.

Unfortunately I didn't get to talk to any developers, but our hosts were amazing. They gave us the tour, answered our questions, and even gave us some sweet swag (which I accidentally left in NYC and am waiting to get mailed to me).

Probably the coolest thing about Stack Overflow was lunch. You're probably thinking, "Lunch couldn't have been the best part." Well it was because they employ two chefs. A head chef who made killer steak fajitas and a pastry chef who made some kick-ass donuts. The only word that comes to mind when I think back is "Amazing!"

###Facebook

On to midtown to see Facebook, which occupies 1 (maybe 2) floors in the Bank of America building. It actually turns out they are moving pretty soon because they need more space. Again, the perils of growth.

We started out with the tour, which was pretty sweet. It was unreal that they had so much technology sitting out in the open. They even had a vending machine of computer accessories to cut down on IT costs. Pretty smart if you ask me.

After the tour, they put us in a room with 5-6 people from different aspects of Facebook and said, "What do you want to know?" This was probably one of the coolest parts of the whole day, but I won't go too far into it. The company culture was awesome, and could be seen in the fact that they all talked about Mark Zuckerberg, or "Zuck" as they called him, as if they'd been long time friends. That's a pretty sweet company culture!

At the end of the tour they let us write something on The Wall. You can't see what I wrote, but it's on the bottom of the Facebook blue and says, "Boiler Up! Î¨2006." Very cool of them to let us leave something there.

###Tumblr

After a long day thus far and a crazy night prior I am super tired by the time we get to Tumblr. Nevertheless, time to see some cool shit/stuff.

We get the tour and we all noticed there are distinct differences between the two development areas. One has more of a grungy feel to it and ended up being the original starting place for Tumblr. The other gave off a sterile vibe. There were a lot of white things everywhere and a ton of light. Two very different paces, but developers seem to prefer one of the other (I totally get this).

When the second group of us finished touring the office, we were greeted by the founder of Tumblr, David Karp. I couldn't believe this was happening. The dude is worth 200+ million, has weekly conversations with Marissa Mayer (Yahoo! CEO), yet he took time out of his day to come talk to us. Needless to say, I kept my cool, but a few of the others we were with didn't. I put a picture below, which is the only one I have where his eyes are open. Additionally, I look like I have a stomach (shit).

We got to talk to him for about 20 minutes where he talked about his daily life and how it changed from programming to running a company. I thought it was an all too real statement when he said he's not the developer he used to be because of the lack of practice. Words that I took to heart.

###Spotify

The best for last.

Spotify was probably the coolest place in my book. The energy in the office was indescribable. Just stepping foot off the elevator made me want to work there. They're foyer had an amazingly intricate, cartoonish timeline of the company. My picture does not do it justice.

{% image 870xAUTO /new_post_img/mashable_dream_job/spotify_foyer.jpg %}

We met Howard, our tour guide, moments after arriving. He actually danced up to us. He lead us around Spotify and told us all about it. I feel like it was the best tour we had all day. 

Unfortunately we didn't get to see much of the tech side because they were in the middle of their Friday wrap-up where we could have heard confidential information. Good call on their part.

I can't really describe too much more, but it was just such an amazing place. I would love to work there later in my career.

##The End

I gained so much and met so many amazing people from this experience. I would like to thank Mashable for putting it on and all the people that took time out of their day to show us around.

One of these days I'll be moving to NYC. I can only hope.
