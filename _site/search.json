No matter what URL you type on the site, it will redirect you to a designated page (mine is set up so that if the file is real/is a file, it will take you to that file and not redirect). Once on the designated page, a “bootstrap” will take over and try to load the page that you requested. If it finds the page, which I have, hidden, outside the www/ on my webspace, it will include it, and if it fails to find it, a 404 is thrown and a custom error message is displayed. Since every page goes through this bootstrap it was easy for me to integrate the autoload function at the beginning. Another way to do it would involve putting the code in the header that you include on every page, although I have not tested this method. So the autoload code is as follows (just the basics): This is just the basic function. If you want to see more examples look at php.net’s page on autoloading. The “$class” variable is the class that is trying to be loaded when initializing and object. Let’s take a look at the code I use on my site to load the classes I use. First, I named the files that have my classes in them something like “class.test.php.” Inside this file there would be a class named something like “Test.” In my code, I change the first character to the lowercase version (this can be accomplished through lcfirst() if using PHP 5.3 ), test if the class I’m trying to load is a file, and if it is, I include the file to needed to call the class. So if I made an object like the following My autoload function would include a file named “class.test.php” if it existed on the server. On php.net, they have examples that throw exceptions, but I feel that this way is a little bit easier. Of course with my method you can always factor in error messaging and anything else you need to make it yours. Hopefully this helped. Before trying this I would have to load all the classes individually, which took a lot of time and confused me sometimes when it didn’t work."

      "body": "As this class rolls on, I will be writing more blogs about what I’ve had to read. This will help me stay on task and better understand what I am trying to read. So here it goes. Nielsen goes over the basics that any book would go over at the start. The point that I liked the most in the first couple paragraphs was that Nielsen describes design as art and engineering. As I read further, I was glad to see that he thought of design more as engineering as opposed to art. I have always thought there are set ways of doing things (most of the time), and this helped me to see that. I liked the example where he states that data can be gathered on a way a user uses a site, or time it takes to accomplish a certain task on a site. After this data is gathered, a person can see which one is better. He then goes into what this book is an is not, which I will not cover, as it is useless to you, the ones reading. Lastly, Nielsen lets us in on fundamental errors that most people/corporations make on their web projects. The one that stood out to me was demoing designs inside companies. It’s good to hear someone say that companies are not the correct testing environment. I know a lot of companies that do this and now I know that it is a bad choice. There are numerous other ones, but for the sake of people reading I will not go into that. Detailed 3 aspects of usability from the International Standards Organization (ISO). All of these are in relation of how to achieve specified goals in a specific context. The Usability Professionals Association (UPA) definition includes how usability is a product development process that focuses around users. From all the definitions that are around, all provide that usability is user centered. The chapter then goes to define how user experience is a much broader topic then just usability. Usability ability impacts everyone everyday, even if they know it or not. Usability metrics measure something about a person, not just characteristics or usual metrics. The chapter then goes one to describe 10 myths about usability. The one that stood out to me was the myth that  ”it’s difficult to to collect reliable data with a small sample size.” After taking a stats class last semester I was sure that there was a definite size needed to conduct a usability study. I am glad to hear that this is not true in this case. I have never heard of “Goal-Directed Design” until I picked up this book. As I read more into it, that concept started to make more sense to me. Why are people doing things? What are they trying to accomplish? This should be the overall goal of design instead of, “What tasks do I need to make this thing do?” As stated in this book, goals motive people to perform activities. Without goals, where are we? Why am I even on the web? Why am I writing this blog? Without goals there would be no need for activities. The chapter goes on to talk about how the products in this day and age are not designed for users. They often make the user feel stupid, make users make mistakes, and often require a user to use to much effort to get the task accomplished. I have felt many times like this. I don’t know where something is, when in fact it’s staring me right in the face. An example from personal experience would be taking a class my sophomore year at Purdue, and the entire class was dedicated to learning Microsoft Office. What a joke, there is Google for a reason. I will never have any of goals while using that program, but I guess some people will. There is this cool little figure in the reading that drew my attention. It illustrated the software development processes evolution. I can’t say that I didn’t see it coming when the first diagram just included build, test, and then ship. I understand where the process is now and I can say that most of the things I would have thought of, but there are still those small steps that help an enormous amount. I liked this article for a couple reasons. First, I liked how it was talking about everyday things that I had encountered. Next, I liked how it gave a bunch of examples from the authors life. I think it helped me to relate more to it on a personal level. I found that the author goes through the same frustration as I do when I get to an item and don’t know where to start or how to use it. I thought, for sure, that a person with an engineering degree from MIT could figure out a microwave no problem, but I guess some of us think differently and what have you. After the author said to look around and see how many everyday things are around you, I was astonished. I found over 500 things just in the place I live, which is a very nice place by the way. Just messing."

      "body": "This article is written by Tim O’Reilly, one of the most foremost experts about the web. The whole goal is to differentiate Web 2.0 from Web 1.0. They have a cool little list that I will display below, which shows what turned into what when Web 2.0 took over. It’s kind of cool for me to see what took what’s place. He then goes on to explain a lot of these more. I liked the fact that he mentioned Google as one of the most influential Web 2.0 site/company/whatever. I think of Google as a leader of web technology and I was glad that someone shared my viewpoint. He talks about rich user experiences, or user-centered design if we were in my CGT 512 class, which plays a vital role in Web 2.0. O’Reilly summaries the whole article with the following points (taken directly from this article) This paper, as the title says, highlights the differences between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. It says the key attributes associated with attributes associated with Web 2.0 include the growth of social networks, bi–directional communication, various ‘glue’ technologies, and significant diversity in content types (Cormode & Krishnamurthy, 2008). I would have to agree with that. The “old” web had almost none of these, as well as those annoying as shit animated GIFs. Like really who thought that would be a good idea? The only “old” social network I can think of is Friendster which isn’t even that old. In the middle of this paper they state that “Web 2.0 [is] viewed as Publish/Subscribe model” and I would have to agree. Take for example all the social media sites. I publish something, then someone who is my friend (i.e. subscribed to me) will get the content I posted. The difference between this and Web 1.0 is Web 1.0 is usually just static content. There is no way to interact, and usually they look awful (just a side note). Web 2.0 is viewed as a platform, which helps to support other online applications. The paper mentions the opening of various API’s (Application Programming Interface) which allow users to add applications to various account on social media sites, as well as just the general web. So basically, everything is built off of Web 2.0 using API’s or other methods, thus Web 2.0 is the platform. Weird how that works huh? This article provides a good background about all social media sites, from the history to the rise and fall of certain sites to now. I liked the opening paragraphs, even if I just skimmed them  because they seemed to be repeating what I already know. Someone who has very limited knowledge of social media would find this extremely helpful. The section that I found the most interesting was about privacy on social networks. Privacy is a huge issue and for the most part still a work in progress. One of the sites that has dealt with privacy really well, I think, is Google . It’s different from Facebook, which has it’s own issues. But Google so far has not had any complaints about privacy that I know of. They say that people, most noteably teens, are the ones that get messed up in the privacy game because they have no clue how what they do will impact the Internet, or the impression the Internet has on them (public nature of the Internet). Lastly, how do social networks stack up in courts. The article asks the question, “do police officers have the right to access content posted to Facebook without a warrant?” What do you think? When I first started to read this article I really didn’t know what to expect, except it being boring, uneventful, what have you, the list goes on and on. But then I actually got into it and it was good for the most part. The introduction shows how something can go from concept to implementation in the matter of a few hours. That is awesome. The place I currently work is like this and I like it a lot. My ideas are put directly into our products in the matter of days, and that is pretty cool if you ask me. I like the way this article talks about corporate structure and what channels of communication/collaboration they use. Some use wikis, blogs, and instant messaging software. But there is a downside. Some companies use email too much, and their employees feel burdened. This may decrease productivity. I know that I for sure would spend more time looking at my emails than working if I ever got that many emails at a time. Even though companies use these, there is another fundamental problem. Knowledge isn’t being captured effectively from the people who actually hold the knowledge. This leads to the loss of tacit knowledge when those people leave a company. How would you like it if a chef left the restaurant and was the only one who knew how to make the dishes? Not ideal right? Discussing the Enterprise 2.0 Ground Rules was not what I thought. I thought it would be something along the lines of which products to use, or what works best. Much to my surprise the two ground rules included making sure their offerings [to employees] were easy to use, and to not impose on users any preconceived notions about how work should proceed or how output should be categorized or structured. So they are basically making it easier for the end user, in this case the employees, as well as providing no little to no structure. I think providing little to no structure is a great idea. Everyone is different and if they can do something the way they like to do it, then they are more likely to use it. This means that the information that is not being collected currently is more likely to be collected in the future."

      "body": "For work I recently had to convert a PSD to XHTML/CSS. The only problem with the design, that I could come to find, was how it called for a content area to meet up with another section, the footer, no matter what the height of the content area. So basically, the bottom of the content area always needs to meet up with the top of the footer. If there was enough text it would work, but if there wasn’t it would fall short. Just for reference the footer is pushed to the bottom of the page already (it will always be at the bottom of the page no matter the amount of text). I put a picture below to help illustrate the problem. After looking around for a CSS solution, which I couldn’t find and haven’t found for the 4 years I’ve been doing this, I turned to jQuery. I first tried using .position(). This function does the following, “Gets the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent.” I didn’t actually read what it did at first and wasted time using this. Then I turned to .offset(), which does the following, “Gets the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document.” The main difference between this method and .position is this element retrieves the position of the element relative to the whole document, not just the offset from the element it’s nested in (parent). This caused a bunch of trouble and finally I found .offset(). Now that I figured out what to use, I used jQuery to find the top of the element that needs to be the certain height, mentioned above, and where it should end. Then with simple subtraction I was able to set a certain height. After figuring this out, I thought I was done. Then, to my surprise, after testing it in all browsers it didn’t work in Google Chrome, but it seemed to work in every other browser. After doing some research I found that Chrome gets the position of elements at a different time then other browsers. Chrome waits for the whole page to load, more specifically images, then grabs the position. Other browsers only need the DOM to load before it grabs the position of an element. So there is an easy work around. After detecting for Chrome, which you can google pretty easily, you can do the following (UPDATED): This is different from the usual: which most people are used to, but due to the way the browsers work, this is what has to be done. This will get you the top of the element after everything has loaded. You may notice it actually change the height when the page is loaded, but it’s instantaeous, so I don’t count it as that big of a deal. Hopefully this helps someone out, as it took me a good amount of time to figure out what was going on. If anyone has any CSS solutions to this problem let me know and I will need to look into that."

      "body": "As most designers know, or should know, there is a load of differences when it comes to designing/implementing a website for different browsers. One of the biggest issues being that Internet Explorer (IE) is horrible/a nightmare no matter how you look at it. A couple years ago, after getting fed up with having a bunch of different browser specific stylesheets, I looked for an alternative to speed up the process or even get rid of this technique. Now since IE will always be different no matter what you do, different stylesheets and conditional CSS (not conditional CSS3 which was just released) will still be needed to have a fully cross-browser friendly website (maybe even some JavaScript also). The thing I found to help out with this nightmare is called a CSS Reset. I found out about this during an interview, which I know not the greatest time to find out something new. After the interview, I went home and looked it up. To my surprise this was exactly what I was looking for. Yahoo! has done a lot of work on User Interface and Design and their definition of a CSS Reset is “a file [that] removes and neutralizes the inconsistent default styling of HTML elements, creating a level playing field across A-grade browsers and providing a sound foundation upon which you can explicitly declare your intentions.” This is great. All browsers are basically the same now? All the default styles used by IE are gone? No longer will I have to use: What a relief. Above is a basic overview of CSS Resets, but know I am going to discuss the difference between two CSS Resets that I have previously used; Normalize.css and Yahoo! Reset CSS. This is my reset of choice. I have been using it on multiple projects to get the look and feel correct across different browsers. The thing I like most about this reset is the fact that it resets everything, and I do mean everything. You get to start from the beginning. After including this as your first stylesheet, you will no longer have weird margin or padding issues in IE. This stylesheet can also help with CSS Specificity (great article about it from Smashing Magazine), which is something every designer should know. The only thing that I do not like about this reset is the fact that font styles are not left intact (italic , bold , etc.) and lists automatically have no bullets. The latter is not a huge concern, I have just been working on a lot of sites that require lists for my job and it is getting annoying to have to redeclare everything. Overall Rating: 9/10 I recently found this CSS Reset from a designer I follow on Twitter. After researching it more, I am starting to incorporate it on a couple sites I am creating for my job. I included this stylesheet in my document, and at first it seemed to function just the same as the Yahoo! reset. I then started doing more and more with it and found that it is a little different from Yahoo’s. This reset seems to be optimized for HTML5, as it has all the new tags and then resets elements based on them. This was not ideal for my situation as my company has yet to start developing websites using HTML5, yet it will be good for the future as HTML5 is continually adopted. This stylesheet, as opposed to Yahoo’s, does not reset everything. It does the following (taken directly from their website): Using this reset was a little different, but over all I liked it. It is a little larger in size compared to the Yahoo Reset but that shouldn’t be a huge deal for most people. If it is I would recommend googling “CSS Compressor.” I cannot wait to go more in-depth with this reset as I feel it will be getting big soon. Overall Rating: 8.5/10"

      "body": "If you’re new to the game, in relations to the social media, have been hiding under a rock, or have just been telling yourself that social media is the work of the devil (thank you waterboy) then obviously something needs to change. Social media is a buzzword, term that has begun to see use in the wider society outside of its originally narrow technical context by nonspecialists who use the term vaguely or imprecisely, that is getting a lot of attention these days. But what is social media? The fact of the matter is, ultimately, there is no set definition for social media. Everyone has a different idea of what it is. In this post, I/we will attempt to determine a valid definition for social media, and if we can categorize it (or not). Lets first break up social media into it’s two basic words; social and media. Social meaning seeking or enjoying the companionship of others (dictionary.com). Media meaning the means of communication (medium of communication) that reach or influence people widely (dictionary.com). From these two definitions we can conclude that social media is a medium of communication that reaches a wide array of people people who are interacting with one another. I just looked at Chris Cookley’s Blog and he basically did the same thing as me, but I feel his definition may be a little better, which I put below. “A companionship or relation involving means of communication that reach people widely.” Now we are getting somewhere. Let’s see if we can categorize social media (what sites/tools fall under the category of social media). I would have to categorize social media sites as sites which allow a vast number of people to interact, collaborate, and share information with a community over an internet medium (Web 2.0). If anyone disagrees, or has anything add, please post and let me know where I can improve on my categorization."

      "body": "The warm up readings helped to describe more to me what visual perception is. I liked the first article as it related a lot of it’s ideas to categorization. The second article went into the debate of top-down processing and bottom-up processing. They are both interesting ideas which I think will be talked about in the readings I still have to complete at this moment as Gibson is mentioned in this article and is an author of a couple I still have to read. The first part of this paper gives the background principles of optics. There is a lot of good information there that helped me to understand the rest of the paper. Even though it is pretty basic, it was a nice refresher from my CGT 511 class that I had, in which we talked about all of this. The first real part of the paper talks about the sampling process in visual perception; how we as humans actually perceive everything we see. I liked how the author pointed out that no animal fully has panoramic vision, meaning no animal can perceive the whole environment at once. For example, if I’m staring at a computer screen writing this blog, I cannot see the person sneaking up behind me to scare the shit out of me. Pardon my french. I liked how they talked about no person is aware of a “sequence” in the visual world, only the “scene,” because I think this is true. After reading this paper the main point that I thought was interesting was how this theory assumes that that perception is direct, as opposed to indirect when looking at other theories. Here, indirect means that we never actually perceive what we are looking at, we only see what is stored in our retinal images. It makes sense, because images we take with our mind aren’t visible to others. The way the author tries to illustrate this is that we look at something, it’s in our retinal image, and we interpret it. We don’t have a little person inside our mind interpreting it for us. He compares this to people looking at a picture, and I know for certain there is no one inside my brain looking at a picture and telling me what I see. This study’s purpose was to test the usefulness of Gestalt’s 11 principles in relations to educational visual screen design. They redesigned a multimedia application that was used to help nursing students learn about wound management. They found, after the redesign, that all the principles were useful in helping the nursing students. This shows that those 11 principles are useful in design and should be somewhat followed when creating a new user interface or experience. This article is about communication, and how it can influence how interfaces are designed. It goes on to say that attention is the key thing that should be looked at. It makes sense to me. If something does not grab my attention I usually will not use it, or if I do, I will not use it for that long. The article talkes about how we, as humans, use attentional signals in collaboration. These attentional signals impact how people design interfaces and systems. I liked how this article related how “we” interpret information “under uncertainty” to Sherlock Holmes. It makes sense. We take into account all the things around us (time, interaction, sensors, etc.) and then we make a decision of where we need to focus our attention. As you can probably tell from the title this article is about visual attention in video games, 3D to be more specific. The researchers had three different hypotheses where they thought both top-down and bottom-up processing will occur, and eye movement patterns are different based on different genres of the game. They tested these hypotheses and found that top-down and bottom-up processing both occurred during game play. They found “bottom-up visual features, including color contrast and movement, subconsciously trigger the visual attention process, thus verifying the bottom-up visual attention theory.” They also found “since action- adventure games [...] are highly goal oriented, top-down visual features control players’ attention more than bottom-up visual features.” So they found that both type of processing occur when playing games. I can see that this would be true as there are a lot of things that go into video games. The storyline is one of the biggest things and I would assume that a high goal-oriented game would have more top-down processing as a person would have to figure something out from their surroundings. Lastly, in regards to eye movement patterns, the researchers found that for first person shooters, the gamer pays more attention (or only pays attention to) the center of the screen. This seems to be the exact opposite for action-adventure games. I never really thought about it until now, but that makes sense. When I play video games, which is rare, it’s usually first person shooters. I can say that I usually only look at the center of the screen because that’s where my focus is. It doesn’t make sense to look anywhere else (you will usually die if you do). The first thing I thought when reading this article, besides how they spelled modeling wrong in the title, was, “what is saliency?” Well I did a little digging and saliency is how noticeable an object is in relations to the things around it. So after getting that down I read the rest of the article. They go over five things, only a few of which I will mention. First, saliency is obtained from low-level features and related to how contrast is used in the context it’s presented in. Second, attention of a person will not change from one thing to another until the former is “disabled.” So basically, if I’m watching TV my attention won’t switch from it until it is turned off/muted. Lastly, the control of attentional deployment is intimately related to scene understanding and object recognition. Meaning, if I don’t understand the scene or objects within the scene I will not focus on it, and it will have never gained my attention. So I just read the part about how we don’t have to read this for the actual readings, but I found it interesting so I guess I will keep it up. My bad in these getting so long, there’s just so much to read."

I mean if I lost that much you better be sure there was something being limited so it doesn’t happen again. Even though security is a big issue, businesses still seem to use social media, as it is a huge opportunity for revenue, mainly from marketing. At the end they stated that education is needed. At first I thought that was weird. Who needs education about social media? Oh wait, I am taking a class on it. In this sense education meant educating new users in organizations about the potential threats that are out there while using Web 2.0 (phishing). I liked this article overall and would suggest it to anyone looking for a good enterprise/big business social media article Unlike the previous paper, this paper is all about the benefits to companies who utilize Web 2.0. It was overall a good article that demonstrated all the good things that can come from utilizing these technologies in the business world. These researchers surveyed over 1,700 executives from companies across the globe and found 69% of the responding companies have gained measurable benefits from the integration of Web 2.0. That is a huge number and is awesome to see that businesses are doing so well from the integration. The go onto talk about all the differences that have come from this, increase in productivity, how it has helped internally, externally, and with suppliers, as well as many other things. The point that hopped off the page to me was, “successful adoption requires that the use of these tools be integrated into the flow of users’ work.” Implementation is key. If it’s integrated wrong, or employees/consumers don’t use it correctly then there is potential for trouble. This actually relates to my thesis topic of social media in higher education. How do you implement it and get it to stick? It’s going to be a tough question to answer, but not impossible. This paper builds off the previously discussed one. It goes more in depth about businesses satisfaction with Web 2.0 and Web Services. I found it interesting that businesses who use Web 2.0 intensely are overall more satisfied with the tools, and they are less likely to stop using them. This makes a lot of sense. From the previous article we found businesses who incorporate Web 2.0 technologies at a higher level make more profit/benefits. If that company is doing a lot better as more tools are implemented, why would they ever stop? Lots of companies Web 2.0 tools internally. This is where companies seem to be making a lot of changes. They use video conferencing, blogs, RSS, etc. and they all help with the transfer of knowledge. Companies reported collaboration was at an all-time high, and some even went as far to say that products were released ahead of schedule due to this. The organizations where this seems to work are the ones where there are no organizational barriers. Makes sense. One section I paid the most attention to was, “the tools that count.” It showed that blogs are better than Social Networking Sites (SNS), and that web services reign supreme. I would have definitely thought that SNS would have out ranked blogs, but much to my surprise it didn’t happen. Something I will bring to where ever I end up working in the future. I could not believe that North America reports the lowest satisfaction with Web 2.0 tools. We created Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, etc. and we don’t like using them. What is going on? Hopefully since 2008 (when this paper was written) something has changed. Adoption of Web 2.0 into enterprises (Enterprise 2.0) is a relatively new subject as Web 2.0 is just starting to hit it’s prime. To start, I was very surprised to find 89% of the people surveyed thought Enterprise 2.0 was at the early stages of development in the market maturity life cycle. Facebook started in 2006, Twitter right after, Wikipedia. What are you thinking? I would have to say to all these people, YOU ARE WRONG. If anything we are in the late majority cycle, relative to the whole. Businesses have been trying to use this since it’s existence, yet it’s not adopted yet? I would say it’s not effectively adopted. This paper discusses the implementation of the technologies. I was surprised to find top-down integration was the lowest percentage. I previously had the notion that all this was implemented by management to make their company better. I was WRONG. Whoops, but it nice to see that the employees have some power in these big organizations and businesses. The number one business driver behind most buisnesses Enterprise 2.0 initiative was increasing productivity. I thought it was obtaining a substantial return on investment (ROI). When I think about it though, it makes sense as productivity increases revenue. When people are more productive they get more shit done, thus making the company more money. I was in awe when 82% of the respondents never established an ROI from the implementation of Enterprise 2.0. I was even more surprised when the same percentage ranked themselves very satisfied to somewhat satisfied with their initiative. I am glad that companies are not giving up and realize there is potential. Internal adoption of social media is a hard thing to accomplish. Some of the main points of this article include how social media is a global phenomenon in all markets. This means all markets no matter economic, social and cultural development. I feel that this is true in some light. Third world countries will definitely be different. They have limited resources, which disable a lot of people from even accessing the Internet. Other than those countries I would agree with that statement, as the world is starting to rely more heavily on social media. I was surprised to see that Asian markets are leading in terms of content creation. I can’t be too surprised as one of the previous articles mentioned it as well. I was also surprised to find video clips are growing the fastest. Sharing video clips? With the way smartphones and social networks are going (Facebook with skype, Google hangouts) I can start to see that sharing video will/could be the next big “thing.” This article mentions how blogs have grown in numbers as well as participation. I remember when no one blogged and Wikipedia was a thing of the past. Surprising that South Korea is the place where the most people read and write blogs. Weird. I know I may not even need to mention this, but the article made a point to so I will as well. Social media impacts your brand reputation. If you post something on a blog that is potentially harmful to your company, you may see changes in revenue, consumer perspective, as well as many other effects. Be CAREFUL. This paper again highlights that video sharing will be one of the new things, as it has been increasing rapidly. This quote summarizes a lot of the article and I found it pretty cool: Social media is a very fast-evolving landscape and one that’s taking an increasingly important role in consumers’ digital lives. Brands that want to engage with consumers in these spaces need to understand how and where and why they are using the many different platforms that enable content creation and sharing. As I continue reading I find 1 in 13 people are active internet users. Wow. Out of the entire world? That is ridiculous to think about. Also, social networking sites are growing rapidly. They are the the “new” thing, and consumers actually use the. Facebook with close 1 billion users, I assume people are using them. They go over the rationale of using SNS, and the top one was finding old friends. Over the years I have been using social networking site, I have found a lot of my old friends from high school, middle school, and even some from elementary school. As social media has many different forms it is considered a very dynamic environment, meaning apparent danger for those using it, more specifically businesses. This comes into play when you are trying to brand your company. Who is that? What do they do? Are they good at what they do? These are just some of the questions that come to mind when I think of “brands.” There are obviously bad things that social media can do to brands, but social media is one of those things that can grow your brand rapidly as well. Even though a little under half of the active internet universe joined a brand community, there is still huge demand for a more social and interactive relationships with brands, and I understand why; the benefits. Many companies showed measurable benefits from using social media as discussed when reviewing a previous article. In order to do this, “a deeper understanding of consumer needs and motivations is the key to unlocking a real understanding of social media and its users.” Brand communities provide huge benefit to the brands involved, driving brand loyalty, endorsement, sales, and much more. “However, understanding the nature of social demand for each consumer, category and market is the key to creating a successful social media experience.”"

      "body": "Cooper idenitifies three models in this reading. They include the implementation, mental, and represented models. The represented model is for the designer though. The represented model is where the designer chooses how to represent the working program. This needs to match the mental model the users have. This makes a lot of sense. When would a designer not want to design for their users? Never. I liked how Cooper talked about how we limit ourselves to what is already there. It’s true. In the 90′s we were stuck in Web1.0 and the stupid animated GIF era. Why were we there so long? We didn’t want to change and we limited ourselves. I feel this is a great example. SNIF-ACT: A Cognitive Model of User Navigation on the World Wide Web This seems to be the first paper I am having a good amount of trouble understanding. I’m thinking it has to do with how links are laid out on a web page and how users follow them. It’s based on scent… or something like that. I am going to read my fellow bloggers pages to see what they think. Hopefully they can help me out in figuring out this paper. So I re-read part of it and I think I figured some of it out. It seems to study a model used to predict user navigation (web-based) and to understand the cognitive approach users use while navigating. I was correct about information scents. They are the relevance of link texts to the users goals on finding information. These ended up being a better predictor of navigation when compared to position. They mentioned satisfice in this article. I barely remembered what it was about, but that’s what they make Google for right? So satisfice is a strategy that attempts to meet criteria for adequacy, rather than to identify an optimal solution. Is there something that could be what I’m looking for? Okay I’m going to click this without looking a little more to find what I actually need. This is just a small example of what it could be. This link explains what a heuristic evaluation is, good thing because I only had a general idea. It states a heuristic evaluation “is [a] discount usability engineering method for quick, cheap, and easy evaluation of a user interface design.” To explain more, it is a way for people to test the usability of a site. Usually there is a small group of examiners who test the site for usability compliance. The goal is to identify usability problems so they can be fixed during the iterative process of design. Jacob Nielsen goes more into it, and after following the links I saw just how much goes into it. Got this error so I could not read it. Found some interesting ones online though that looked pretty cool."

The only stipulation was communication needed to be done solely through Twitter. What an experience to say the least. My group’s topics included social media uses in the US and Internationally. Finding information on such topics was not hard, but when trying to combine the entire classes information it started to get harder. We ended up using Google Docs to organize our presentation, which I thought it was a good plan of action and seemed to work well for the class. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, I was unable to present my portion to the class, but I heard it went pretty well. Our teacher said we did pretty good for only having a week and only communicating via social media. When we were assigned topics I didn’t really think it would be hard to get this task done. Boy was I wrong. My group met outside of class twice to figure out our game plan for this presentation. I think that was a good thing, being able to meet in small groups. During the week, I got totally lost with what was going on. I have a lot of things going on in my life at this moment and didn’t have time to keep up with everything. Looking through the class Twitter list seemed to help, but I still seemed to have a hard time sifting through all the previous Tweets to find what I was looking for. It may have been that some Tweets didn’t have #hashtags, or maybe I just missed it. I’ve been known to overlook items before, and this was the only hard part about this assignment. Overall, I feel everything went well. It was hard collaborating with others over social media platforms when I’ve never done it before. This helped open my eyes to my research topic, social media in higher education. I thought of some good ideas for testing my sample population and found things that I now want to change after going through this experience."

      "body": "Yesterday I had the pleasure of participating in my first Google hangout. For my social media class this semester, we were again tasked with delivering a presentation to the class as a class. This time around, the class decided to use Google more for our needed collaboration instead of Twitter as we did before. We used Google hangouts to talk to one another and Google Docs to keep track of everything we were coming up with. In the end, we finalized our presentation topics, topic order, and general concerns we all had. After this experience I felt that I needed to write about my first experience with the Google Hangout. First and foremost, it was one of the better online video chatting services I have used. In the past, most programs decided either not to work, had too much dependence on flash, or were too hard to use. I found the hangout relatively easy to figure out. One person sets it up, invites others to “hangout,” and there you have it, a video conference. When you’re in a room video chatting with 10 people, keeping up with who is currently talking can get tough. Google figured this could be a problem and implemented a simple solution, which is actually pretty cool. Depending on how much noise you make on your end, Google will determine who is talking and show them in the main display. From what I understand, from using it, whoever makes the most noise is featured on the main display. I had to plug-in my computer to charge at the beginning of the hangout. Me just moving the table my computer was on made noise and caused the hangout to think I was talking a lot. This definitely beats having to click on different screens when the person who’s talking changes. Lastly, Google Hangouts have the ability for video sharing. I didn’t get to play around with it too much, but it seems like a cool little feature that would be useful (maybe another time waster). It seems a little like Chill.com, an online video sharing community. The biggest con of Google Hangouts is the performance issues. I have a decent computer that can handle almost anything at the moment. When I opened the hangout my computer instantly started slowing down. It took a long time to switch through applications. For instance, I wanted to write something on the google doc we were editing at the same time of the presentation, and it took me a little time to get to document and edit it. I feel that hangouts are very CPU intensive. I stayed after our hangout was over to chat with another person about a different presentation, and it seemed to work a lot faster. It makes sense, the more people in the hangout the slower it is. I mentioned how Google implemented a solution to change to the video of the person talking above. While it s a good idea, it’s slow as I just mentioned. When the feed finally stopped on someone who was supposedly talking, they weren’t talking anymore. I felt like I was behind in the conversation many a times. Overall, I liked the Google hangout. It was a new experience and seemed to work for our class. I didn’t like how I had to restart my computer after the chat just to get it working normally again. I would recommend this to anyone, yet I would caution against having more than 5-6 people in the hangout, or you are just asking for a slow computer."

Purpose The purpose of this study was to report on how older individuals have trouble with the internet as their age increases. The researchers wanted to find what features were hardest for people with failing vision, motor skills, literacy, etc. to use. Their overarching goal was to show how bad web design can have a big impact on the elderly population Methods The authors did a usability test to assess how the site’s “features” affected elderly individuals. The researchers evaluated 125 websites total: 50 state government (.gov) Web sites, 50 commercial (.com) Web sites composed of 25 health-related sites and 25 online newspapers, and 25 nonprofit (.org) health-related Web sites (Becker, 2004). Then the researchers had a rater, knowledgeable with the NIA/NLM and homepage guidelines, complete a usability assessment for the websites selected. Main Findings After concluding the usability test, the researchers found 93% of the sites surveyed used very small font on homepage content. This affects negatively a good portion of older people. They also found 24% of sampled sites pose a usability barrier in terms of site navigation. Less than 15% of all sites offer translation, which can directly affect the amount of elderly people able to read the content. Analysis This paper makes valid points. I liked how the researchers identified the things that elderly people like and things they have trouble with. For example, elderly people have trouble with drop-down menus as there is a great amount of precision needed to get the mouse over a small area. I think this article did a good job, hopefully the rater was good, at showing where a lot of current websites fail today. With baby boomers starting to hit their senior years, we need to start developing solutions that will fit the needs of an ever-growing part of our population, at least for another 50 years tops."

      "body": "This past week my class had to, yet again, give a presentation to the class as a class. We were again limited to using social networks and social media to collaborate on this project. This time, we weren’t only limited to Twitter. As a class, we held meetings on Google Hangouts, which I wrote a summary of following it. I felt we were able to communicate very well with the Google Hangout. Some people in our class had technical problems, but were able to use the chat feature and still interact with the rest of us. To me, a Google Hangout is better than using Twitter with a hashtag. Twitter only allows for 140 characters, and with that small amount of words to work with, it’s hard to put exactly what you are thinking, especially when high levels of detail are involved. Google Hangouts helped us solve that exact problem. People could interact in real-time and voice what they were thinking about. I feel this was a gigantic help this time around. We also used Google Docs in addition to Twitter and Google to help us keep track of what we were talking about. I liked this tactic as I could easily switch to the document we were all editing and everyone’s ideas were already there. It made it easier to remember what we were talking about before, and what smaller details were talked about. This presentation opened my eyes to what had been sitting in front of me for quite some time now. I work with people who know a lot about this stuff as they started doing it a long time ago. Knowing internet culture can be an extremely valuable skill to have. In this day and age, companies hire people who know how to relate to their audience, and knowing the ins and outs of internet culture is a great way to know your audience. Knowing what internet culture is all about can also help with finding information or interacting with others on the internet. If you know where to look and how to ask, one can find almost anything on the internet. So figuring out what people want to hear, or how they react to certain things can be a game changer. When we were ready to present, our teacher told us one more thing we had to do. We had to use Twitter during our presentations. Our teacher stated, “as long as you stay on topic, almost anything is acceptable.” I had never done this before. Wouldn’t typing what I’m thinking and listening to another person talk be difficult? Well it all turned out pretty well, but there were somethings I liked and didn’t like about the experience. I liked how I could chat with others about something that is going on right in front of me. Too many times I will get bored in class and then not pay attention. This actually helped me stay on topic as other people could offer their opinions in addition to the presenter. When Twitter is used during presentations it helps to get a lot of information to your audience. Everyone has their own little tid bits of information they know/have found about a certain subject. When they all get in a room and someone is talking about their subject, other’s will share their information. For example, while talking about Trolling, Twitter was being used to send out examples of trolling. The one thing I didn’t like was that it kind of distracted me from the presentation. I feel I was present for most of every presentation, but I felt that I missed parts of some, and maybe section of others. This was due to me wanting to share information the presenter was talking about, and by the time I post it they are already talking about the next subject. I also didn’t like it when I was the person presenting. It felt like my audience was pre-occupied and wasn’t listening to what I was saying. Overall, this was a good experience. I liked the topics we presented on and ended up learning a lot. Twitter as a back-channel is still new to me and I don’t know if I really like it that much, especially when I am presenting. I guess only time will tell."

I just wanted to cover what topics I might be considering or what maybe some ideas people can help me out with. Throughout this semester, even though it has only been a few weeks, I have been introduced to the world of social media in a way that I really cannot explain. All of my classes, friends, parent even, use social media. For that reason I wanted to do research on how individuals, ranging in age from 18-30, feel about Facebook and Twitter, when compared to one another. This would involve a simple survey that people would take with predetermined questions to find out if people use Twitter and Facebook for different things, and overall which platform they like better. This would be from the individuals perspective, of course. There is only one way to find out about what others think, ask them. These are the questions I will be trying to solve, not the questions I will be asking the individuals participating in the study. I get confused sometimes so I figured I would clarify. Who really cares about this research? Good question. If no one cares then why do it. Well I feel various types of people will benefit from this research. I feel the people who will benefit most will be marketers. They need to be able find out what online platform is best for their company. How are people using it? How can we portray our company in a good light to people? What is trending? The list goes on and on. People care why others use the different platforms. Also, I care, not just because I have to but because this really interests me. Why sometimes do I feel like not using a specific social media on a certain day? Is it something to do with the site and what’s its entire goal? Very interesting. This is related to my research in the aspect of social media. My final thesis focuses on social media in higher education, more specifically the integration of microblogging into the classroom and how effective it is from the student’s perspective. Finding out why people use different social media platforms could definitely help me out in my research. It can help me determine what type of people will react well to integration with a microblogging and why they might feel that way. Can’t wait to actually get this started, maybe…. I guess we’ll see where how it goes."

      "body": "In this day and age, with everyone on social networks utilizing social media, what are you portraying to your audience? Do you like to party? Are you interested in certain topics? What have you been doing for the past few months? All these questions become easy to answer once you take a look at someone’s social networking sites, and their use of social media. This weeks reading is all about online identity management, and I am going to provide a recap about a few of the things we had to read for my social media class. Sorry it got kind of long. There is just so much I want to cover after reading these. Are you the person you want to be? In real life? Online? Well now, you can’t really control who you are in real person, but online is a different story. Pearson makes the point that anyone can be anyone they want to be online. Actors is the term she used for it. People can create an identity based on the rest of the population they are around. This can sometimes follow closely with reality, but in other cases it drastically differs. Pearson talks about a front-stage and back-stage of the web. The front-stage is where “individuals play their parts.” They act like the person they want to be, not who they are. On the front-stage their performances are constructed and displayed for all to see; well I guess not really all now that we have “privacy” settings. Alternatively, the back-stage is the private part of your online identity. These two stages are starting to mix as people are starting to trade inadvertent disclosure for better management of networks, ties and social bonds. This is interesting to me. People would give up their privacy to have a better online identity. I would never do that. My “friends” know who I am, where I live (mostly), what I do in my spare time, and that’s it. They don’t know about how I feel about current events, my views on political issues, and the list goes on and on. Why would anyone ever put that kind of stuff out there? I guess it really depends on the person. In reality, there are physical barriers barring you from seeing others and portraying  your identity across the masses. Not true for online identities. They can span the globe, or they already do if you think about it. This makes it easier to portray yourself, as an individual. Is it a good thing? It depends on how you “identify” yourself. People will perform roles using code and signs from online culture to create an identity that can cross social networking sites. This is kind of funny to me as people also create an identity based on the platform they are using. How can you develop an identity from various social networking sites (SNS) when they are all so different? It’s tricky and I am not going to go into it here, but it is possible. This article offered great insight into how people “act” online when they know others are watching, even if they don’t know those others (key point I forgot to mention). People are careful, well most at least, about what they put online because the internet is a “public space” where anyone can see anything. Great article overall, I would recommend it for anyone interested in online identity. This paper seems to build on the previously reviewed one, using Goffman to help prove their points. Actor. Are you one? I would tend to say yes. Most people are very different online compared to real life. Actors do things in real-time. They interact with you, look at your content, as well as many other things. If you are an actor, then what is an artifact. An artifact is something that results from part of your past performances, thus they are representations not performances. What is a performance then? A performance is classified as how actors behave with each other. So basically everything you do online, where you interact with another person, is considered a performance, according to this paper. Sounds about right, how else would someone classify performance. This paper also goes into front-stage and back-stage like the previous paper. The front-stage is used to present an idealized version of yourself according to a specific goal. This ties into the fact that online behavior is determined by social norms and goals of the specific settings (environments) you are engaging with. The back-stage is a “place where impression fostered by performance is knowingly contradicted as a matter of course.” The back-stage is what creates the front, and is the real work necessary to keep up appearances. This article explained in more detail that the back-stage is not necessarily private. People can view everything but get an overall impression from the front-stage. They talked also about the lowest common denominator; “A theory of lowest common denominator culture is more appropriate to exhibition spaces replete with persistent content than single context performances. It offers a potential an explanation for three aspects of social network sites.” I put the three aspects they are talking about below, but I just wanted to explain this a little more. Lowest common denominator refers to how you are represented in relation to the audience around you. In one arena a person may have a clean-cut professional profile, and then in another place the same person may have something totally different. Yes I put the abstract below, not because I didn’t read it, but because it’s a great overview of what this article does. After you read that part, I put a few more ideas/comment after about the rest of the paper. Abstract The present study investigates self-presentation in anonymous setting and explores differences in self-presentation by distinct ethno-racial groups. Based on content analysis of 83 Facebook proﬁles of African Americans, Latino, Indian and Vietnamese ancestry students, supplemented by 63 in-person interviews, we found that ethno-racial identities are salient and highly elaborated. The intensive investments of minorities in presenting highly social, culturally explicit and elaborated narratives of self reﬂect a certain resistance to the racial silencing of minorities by dominant color-blind ideologies of broader society. In the nonymous environment of Facebook, various dimensions of identity claims appear to be grounded in ofﬂine realities as revealed in interviews and observations of campus social dynamics. Me The biggest qualm I have with this paper is the location of the study. It takes place at a college where it is dominated by organizations who express ethno-racial identities. In fact, 66.2% of all organizations at this school could be considered ethno-racial social spaces devoted to identities of nonwhite students. What if they would have done it at another university? I feel that they are only able to generalize to a small subset of our overall population. I understand the different cultures portray themselves differently, but I thought different cultures/ethnicity would exhibit almost the same behavior as the majority culture. I guess that’s a bit of narrow-mindedness on my part, but I never really thought about it. At the end of this study they found that ethno-racial identities are salient and highly elaborated. They have been found to be more social by investing more time into how their online identity, as well as the “About Me” section on most SNS, is portrayed to the masses. It seems that people who are apart of this post more culturally explicit content and elaborate narratives more so than others. The goal of this research paper is to gain a further understanding of how users manage different social networks through one system. They then want to see how users keep in contact with their past social groups (in a few months it will be my college friends) and their current workplace connections. They studied Facebook profiles as well as conducted interviews with employees, more specifically younger employees, from a large software development company. After conducing their research they found Facebook is permeating the workplace, or spreading throughout the workplace. It is becoming part of young people’s routine in the workday. Weird, I don’t use Facebook at work, oh wait… shit I do, and I do a lot. It’s really not what you’re thinking, I don’t just sit around and scan the online identities of my fellow “friends,” I get to use it for work; integrating Facebook into application and whatnot. I can see how people would want this to become part of the workday. Companies (this company, they generalize) acknowledge SNS offer many benefits, not only to their bottom line, but to their employee moral and well-being. SNS can be used to increase communication and collaboration among employees, the stated. Current employees can also use SNS to learn about new employees and/or team members. Sounds great, hopefully none of my online identities are offensive, I have been trying to make it this way for a long time. On to the part about how users manage various profiles, professional and personal. Multiple user profiles help people manage their online identities without unintended leakage between corporate and social personas. Great, I can have a personal life as well as one at work, but I wonder, are those two personas really different? I would contend that they mix and mash together. If someone searches my name on Google, someone would find my personal site (blog as of now), my social networks, and my company profile/blog posts. Are they really going to differentiate the two? I hope so, but can only hope for so much. Managing multiple profiles can be a huge burden also, as this article pointed out. Settings and controls on most platforms are either non-existent or extremely complicated. The authors of this paper contend that better authoring tools are necessary for users to do this more efficiently. Wow, this paper was written by my professor and two classmates. Weird to think that in about half a year, people could be reading my papers and actually taking something from it. Now that we’re over that, this paper basically talks about how colleges should be teaching social media literacy, which will help students preparing for entering the job market. It goes on to discuss the impact of online information during the employment process, and it finally argues for the teaching of social media literacy, specific to online identity management, in the undergraduate curriculum. Their findings, from the school of engineering, emphasized four main things: As I would love to write more and go over all of these individually, unfortunately I am not. The part I found most interesting was most people (12/15 from the study) had no clue employers use online information to find out more about you and make judgments. How could someone NOT know this???? Baffling. I know I sound a little harsh, and it may seem apparent to me as I am in the technology field, but with the Internet being so prominent and social networking sites being so big, how do you miss that??? I liked the points made in the article, and most of them do relate to me. Relating them to my research is a whole different story, as I am not studying online identity. I think the only case I could make for investigating it in my research would be how students perceive other students, how teachers perceive students, and vice versa. Stages (front and back) they are social contexts. Anything can be a front or back stage, what matters is perception.

      "body": "Facebook has been changing so many things in the past few months. First, the new news feed. Top stories? Do I care? Second, the music app. Is it cool? Yes, I like to see to what my friends are listening to. And lastly, the new Timeline. Cool? Very, I think. It’s all the information you already had (no Facebook isn’t displaying new stuff about you, other than who you unfriend) in a new format. I like it overall. Even with all these changes, which are supposed to make your life easier, is it actually doing that? The overwhelming answer I get from people I am around most is “No.” I, particularly, got angry when I had to go through the daunting task of removing myself from pictures my friends had tagged me in. Even though I am of age, 22, and participating in a Purdue tradition, I felt I may need to remove some of the Facebook pictures from our “breakfast club” experiences this year. It may come as no surprise, but Facebook, yet again, changed the process of removing yourself from pictures (and removing them from your timeline for that matter). I am going to go through the process and point out the areas of concern, from my point of view. So that’s the new way to remove yourself from pictures on Facebook. Why they hide everything and change everything, who knows? I have a feeling they want you to keep your information up as long as possible. Aside from the fact it takes 3x longer to remove yourself and there is no batch removal feature, this design seems to disregard Gestalt’s principle of Similarity. Well this is what I orginially thought, but my professor pointed out (in a comment below) the problem is not Similarity, it’s the information scent. In this example, two options, which in my eyes are totally different, are combined. When I look for “remove tag,” and saw “Report,” I immediately stopped reading because I don’t think report and remove tag do the same sort of thing. This just really pissed me off so I decided to write about it. Hopefully you all find it at least a little bit interesting."

      "body": "Another thing to read, another thing to write about. This article stresses persuasive usability - integrating usability into everything we do. The authors contend, and rightfully so, that usability should not be an add-on, it should be thought out from the beginning. Two categories of usability methods exist (very broad). They then go over the persuasive usability design process, which I put a picture of below. It is pretty straight forward. Each process is completed, and before moving on to the next process an evaluation is required. This is definitely an iterative process as the arrows from evaluation back to the specific step in the process are double sided. This means it can go back and forth as many times as necessary. Throughout this paper, I feel they give great information. I liked how they outlined the project schedule. I am currently working on 2-3 entrepreneurial endeavors and this will definitely help me, as well as the group of people I am working with. Along with the project schedule, they outline project management. It’s almost like a project management for dummies, but it does a great job of getting the point across as well as explaining everything in a good amount of detail. The last thing I wanted to shed light on is the people involved and how much time they spend working as the project progresses. It is just amazing to me how much time a the usability specialist needs to spend working on a specific project. They seem to work on the project a lot, up until the launch, yet they are never really done. I would have thought the HTML/Graphic Designer would have to work a lot more, but it seems as these two positions work only at specific parts of the timeline. Take a look at the graphic below to see what I am talking about. Overall this chapter of the book (cited below) is very good. It provides copious amounts of information, which is useful to anyone in the usability field as well as the entrepreneurial field. Citation: Brinck, T., Gergle, D., and Wood, S.D.

I stood there for about 5 minutes finicking with the stupid sink’s motion sensor, and I finally got it to work to the point where I could wash the soap off my hands. I realized this is an example of a bad usability, yet I didn’t want to use one of my good/bad design blog posts, required for CGT 512, so I am passing it off as thoughts and ideas. I couldn’t wash my hands when using the automatic sink. I even covered up the sensor and it didn’t turn on. Huge problem in todays germ infested world. Before you ask, no, I am not a germaphobe. Being clean is being cool. Sounds exactly like what my first grade teacher said to me. From my understanding, automatic faucets, and for that matter automatic toilets, work using an infrared signal. When it is disrupted they will either turn on, or flush in the toilets case. So how can we/I make this better? The sink not the toilet. The Japanese got the toilet on lock as of now. I have put down a couple of my thoughts when it comes to this. Some may not be viable, but it is still cool to think about."

      "body": "And so it begins again. Lets get to talking about what I read in relation to social capital The relationships you have can be classified based on your interaction. People we know very well, our close friends or family, are said to be strong ties. Conversely, acquaintances of ours are said to be weak ties.  This paper argues weak ties are just as important as strong ties. The main argument of this paper, which it argues against, “asserts that our acquaintances (weak ties) are less likely to be socially involved with one another than are our close friends (strong ties).” The author argues weak ties are vital for an individuals integration into modern society. They offer various examples, but one stood out to me. They contend weak ties can connect a groups of tightly knit individuals. To explain a little further, two people are acquaintances, yet they have their own group of close friends. These two people now have the opportunity to connect with people from the other group, due to this acquaintance, or weak tie. This makes sense to me, as I can relate it to my life while I am looking for a job after college. Speaking of job hunting, this paper mentioned it also. Researchers found “less-well-educated respondents were most likely to use strong ties for jobs.” This statement makes me laugh, not only because of how true it is, but because of how unfair and disappointing it is. They basically say, people who do less will get the same as people who do more just because they “know” people. This world reflects around the principle, “it’s not what you know, it’s who you know.” Very unfortunate. Can being a Facebook user help your social capital? Well first I should explain what social capital is. Social capital are resources accumulated through relationships among people. This can be in the form of information, personal relationships, the capacity to organize group, and much more. This paper introduces the idea of bridging and bonding social capital. The author states bonding social capital occurs between individuals strong ties, while bridging social capital is the exact opposite; weak ties. Bridging social capital can be defined as the building of connections between groups. Bridging social capital is more fragile than bonding social capital, but it is also more likely to foster social inclusion. The goal of this study was to see if Facebook plays any role in bridging social capital. The authors found, after conducting a study at MSU, Facebook is implicated in students efforts to develop and maintain the bridging of social capital at college. They don’t know exactly how, but they found it is definitely involved. They also found a positive relationship between certain kinds of Facebook use and maintenance and creation of social capital. This paper is good and builds off the previous paper in the form of weak ties, and how they are directly related to social bridging, which some contend is better than social bonding. Good paper overall. A question that has been asked often when it comes to cultures and social media is, “Do believed cultural differences profoundly impact how people use social networking services (SNS)?” The main goal of this study was to clarify the relationship between cultural differences and motivation of SNS uses and between motivation of SNS use and social capital. I liked how they compared the different functions of SNS. They compared 3 different theories, yet it all amounts to the same basic functions after studying each theory closely. To measure what they were looking for they gave a survey in Korea, China, and the USA. After compiling the data obtained from these surveys (questions at right) they found Korea has a high sense of individualism, and China, which reports high levels of masculinity, only have a moderate sense of individualism. Kind of weird right? The researchers also found Korea and China have users who find experts for advice on decisions as well as emotional situations. This relates closely with social capital, whereas the USA related to bridging social capital better. Overall, the researchers found it is hard to explain the relationship between cultural differences and motivation of SNS uses. They also found social capital bonding is less influential than bridging social capital, which is verified from the past two articles reviewed as well. Well this seems to be the paper that preceded the first paper reviewed for this reflection. I can see how the other paper built off this one, yet there are some things worth pointing out. First, the author states the personal experiences of individuals are closely bound up with larger-scale aspects of social structure. So you fit into the world somewhere. You are the smaller aspect and the world is the large structure you fit into. Next, they brought up the topic of strong and weak ties. Go figure. Weak ties are seen as indispensable to individuals opportunities and integration into the community. VERY IMPORTANT, even more so than strong ties. Strong ties, the author states, leads to overall fragmentation, which I would assume is bad. It’s different to hear people categorize weak ties are better than strong ties. I initially though strong ties would be better because you actually know the person well. It makes sense because with strong ties, you will have the people you know well and won’t want to leave your comfort zone. The opposite is true with weak ties, you barely know them and you want to get out there. Lastly, the author brings up the point of what are we going to do when analyzing a tie when it is categorized not as weak or strong (based off strength), but as negative, positive, etc. I really don’t know, but it is something interesting to think about. This article seems to provide a general overview of  the social sciences in regards to networks. “For social scientists, the default expectation has been that different networks (and nodes within them) will have varying network properties and that these variations account for differences in outcomes for the networks (or nodes).” Learn more about Network Analysis. Social sciences seem like a whole different story. There are so many things to study, where do you start? Well social scientists put more emphasis on the individual node. They do this because the outcomes they observe are driven by the fact that traditional social science theories focus largely on the individual. They have to show that network theory can explain the same outcomes that have been observed in tradition social sciences. Some social scientists argue observation is a lot better than asking people about their experiences. I would tend to agree, but with some kinds of research direct observation can be really hard, so asking would be the only way to gather data. They finally conclude by saying social and physical sciences are at different points “along the (related) continua of universalism to particularism, and simplicity to complexity.” I never thought I’d see the day when something was assigned to for me to read and I have already read it. This paper is currently in my literature review for my thesis, so lets explore it a little more. This paper aims to observe how microblogging is used (microblogging phenomenon). They observer the topical and geographical information associated with Twitter. Before going on, I would like to point out that Twitter is very location specific, as is almost every technology. After conducting their study, the researchers found users use Twitter for various reasons, or Twitter users have certian intentions when using Twitter. All of these intentions seem real. Recently, Steve Jobs passed away, RIP you have done so much. I found out about the news two minutes after it happened via Twitter. I also use Twitter to obtain information. People post copious amounts of information in the public domain and it is easy to access. Depending on who you get the information from, it could be invaluable or just straight crap. This paper found individuals have different motivations and utilities used when using microblogging platforms. I’m glad we had to read this paper as it demonstrates target audiences for future studies. Very good paper and I would read it again, maybe haha."

      "body": "This week's reading reflection is going to be a little different. I have been just reading the articles and summarizing them, but at the request of my teacher, I will try to reflect more on them. So here it goes. This chapter of Cooper goes very in-depth on modeling users through the use of personas and goals. The chapter goes into a lot of detail about what a persona is, as well as the many different types of personas, which I will not get into now. A persona (Cooper, 2007) is a way to represent complex phenomena with a useful abstraction. They “provide us with a precise way of thinking and communicating about how users behave, how they think, what they wish to accomplish, and why” (Cooper, 2007). Personas are formed based off the users motivations and goals, not something like demographics, communication channels, etc. This makes a bunch of sense. If I want to understand how somebody works, I want to know how they feel, why they are doing it, not what race are they, or how they get their information. Cooper also states personas need to be based off DATA, not stereotypes. Data is key he says, rightly so; without it one cannot form a persona that is free of stereotypes (although provisional personas can sometimes get mixed up with stereotypes even if it’s not the designers intention). We got into a little argument in class last week about the creation of personas. Half the class wanted to be general, and the other half (professor) wanted to be more specific. After reading Cooper’s chapter, I realize we need to be more specific, but cover a broader range of people using multiple personas. Cooper says we need to accommodate a variety of users and the way to do that is to design for specific types of individuals with specific needs. I would say getting a specific group of users to like your product rather than having everyone thinking your product is okay, or bad, is the what designers should strive for. A product cannot meet the needs of every users, that’s why personas are a great way to get a feel of potential users. Cooper states that personas are represented as an individual person, yet they represent a group. Confused? So was I. An example of this would be: I am wanting to buy a car. I want it to be fast, good looking, and have high mileage. This represents me as a persona. Yet, there are other people out there who are just like me. This is the group part. Cooper then goes on to talk about how to actually determine personas using a seven step process, which is too long to go over for this post. Now that Cooper has talked about research, collecting data, and everything that goes along with that, how does on translate into a design? Well, Cooper states it is a 4 step process: developing scenarios, defining requirements, defining the interaction framework, and then filling the framework with increasing amounts of detail. So that’s it….. Just messing, I wish. The first important thing Cooper talks about are scenarios, or narratives. They are the “story” which the product is designed around. Cooper talks about John Carroll and his scenario-based design, which focuses on describing how users accomplish tasks. He then rips it apart stating they focus too much on tasks and not enough on motivation, as well as the actor is too abstract. This goes back to the previous chapter where he states motivation and behaviors are the way to go. I like how he then integrates the idea of personas into persona-based scenarios. It makes sense to combine these two. The definition he provides states, “persona-based scenarios are concise narrative descriptions of one or more personas using a product to achieve specific goals” (Cooper, 2007). He then goes over the three types of scenarios, which build off one another (context, key path, and validation). Like the next article, which I actually read before these chapter, Cooper delineates a difference between use cases and persona-based scenarios. I’ve explained them more in the next article, so look there for further explanation. Lastly, he goes into the step by step process of creating a requirements definition, which is long and will not be detailed here. I feel that is it a good process, but as Cooper said it is an iterative process, meaning it can continue for a long time (hopefully not). Whoops, forgot to mention an extremely important point. Figure out what the product does before thinking about how it works, behaves, or looks. This is a huge deal. If you don’t do this, you may be caught in a never-ending cycle of design. This book chapter was great. It solidified what we talked about in class last week about personas, data collection, and various other things. I liked to the first thing emphasized in this chapter was do fix problems EARLY, in the design and requirements phase. It is 100x more expensive to change something after the product is completed, as compared to the early phases. I guess I knew this already, but it was nice to hear someone else agree with me. The chapter then goes into why do we need requirements and where do we get them from. Where do we get them from? The user/client? We, as developers/UI engineers, choose them? Well they say that both are true. Shouldn’t the client have the requirements? Who knows, they probably don’t even know what they want at this point. In the end, the authors say requirements are formed from gathering data, analyzing it, and interpreting activities established from a sound understanding of users’ needs. This definition really brings it all together, even though it is putting more work on the UI designer/engineer. Oh well, a job is a job. The author also does a good job of explaining personas more. Also, they discuss the various requirements relative to the users’ environment. There are four main ones, listed but not defined, they go over; physical environment, social environment, organizational environment, and technical environment. It never occurred to me, consciously, people need to design for different environments. What if your designing something for a client where they can barely see due to safety requirements? What would you have to do? Make everything brighter I would assume. Lastly, I wanted to highlight essential use cases, which are combination of scenarios and traditional use cases (in regards to data analysis, interpretation, and presentation). I had never heard of these. I knew scenarios involved descriptions of tasks (stories), and use cases deal more with system-user interaction. I liked how there is something in the middle, and that thing is an essential use case. Essential use cases “represent abstractions from scenarios [...] and try to avoid the assumptions of a traditional use case.”"

      "body": "Self-organizing is becoming huge these days, just look at Occupy Wall Street. These articles present ideas in which self-organization has been accomplished and what it took to accomplish it. Below I wrote my reflection pertaining to these articles, instead of a summary which I used to do. Hopefully it’s a little better than the past posts. Back when I was growing up, early to mid ninety’s, there was a public out cry about all the ill-advised things going on around the Catholic church, most of which related to child molestation. I really didn’t hear anything about it until I was in high school, and I think to myself, why? This article investigates this exact question. So why didn’t more people know about this. Simple, barriers. How are you going to tell someone? Phone, email, mail, fliers, etc.? In this day and age email was not yet a thing everyone had. Sending fliers through mail was a daunting task involving photocopying and the usual process of mailing information. This was a deterrent for most people so they didn’t even consider doing it because of the time involved. What happened in the late 90′s, the Internet started to become what it is today. Physical barriers were removed from the equation, making it easy for anyone to share information with one another. Groups protesting the Catholic church were now able to reach members from other parishes, as well as send mass messages, not only to people in the local area, but individuals across the world. So why did they finally get caught and outed, social media and the Internet. Elections and social media is a new thing, even in the USA, but how do foreign countries use it, like Iran? Well apart from the organizing of people and sharing of information, it is unclear of the role Twitter (social media) played in the Iran election. This paper does an in-depth analysis of this, yet comes up short of how it was used. They need to have further inspection to really understand what is going on. The age of Facebook, Twitter, Google , and various other social networks are upon us, I’m sure you know. How do you manage your online identity? Well for starters you use your real name probably. Christopher Poole, founder of 4chan, says this is your first mistake. Why tell people who you are? He says Facebook and Google only allow you to be one person online, when in actuality you are a different person according to the context/situation you are in. Take for example, 4chan, one of the biggest and oddest social networks on the web today. You don’t have to provide your real name to register, instead you get a handle, or something you can identify yourself with. Although most people post as “Anonymous,” others have dedicated names that they even introduce themselves as in the real world. Why would they want to confine themselves to just one person when they actively participate in many different environments? Online identity is a huge thing today. The top social networking sites are forcing us, the users, to be only one person. Poole stated at a recent conference, that he used to think developers (he was talking to Facebook) set the bar for identity. He later realized that users do, which I completely agree with. Along with this article comes the removal of physical boundaries. Anonymous, a “hive-mind,” organizes attacks on many sites around the world, Visa and MasterCard to name two. They are able to do this due to the fact that no physical barriers restrict them, so anyone can help with the attack as long as they download a specific application. Over the past half decade, many uprisings in the Middle East have been taking place, many of which I had no clue about. Arab Spring is what is used to describe these. But how are people organizing and sharing information? Social Media, more specifically Facebook, and in some countries cases Twitter. I feel like a broken record saying this, but what helped them the most is the removal of physical barriers. Now, people can get information out quickly and with relative ease. Many individuals living in these countries have smart phones, and when asked, “what are you taking pictures of?” they respond with, “Ourselves, Our Revolution, We put it on Facebook. [...] It’s how we tell the world what’s happening.” This is AWESOME, to say the least. Never before has this be able to happen. I still find it extremely cool how people in Egypt communicated when the government shut down the internet and cell phone network; hand signals. They would detail when and where to meet the next day using them. Incredible. I find it interesting that people writing this article didn’t initially think social media played a big role in these situation. They finally figured out they are wrong, which is good, as social media is starting to play a huge role in almost every aspect of news and information sharing. Occupy Wall Street recently was a trending topic on Twitter, I haven’t checked in a while, but it may still be. They are protesters commenting that they are part of the 99% who will not stand for the greed and corruption of the 1% (referring to the United States population). Protesters have “occupied” Wall Street and don’t look like they will be moving any time soon. How was this modern-day sit-in started? Who are the leaders? What do they want? Social media actually started this gathering, regarding organization, and there are no leaders, everyone is a leader. So how does that work out? Decisions are made by everyone. With the technology today there are many, easy ways to collaborate, even without a computer. They are organizing, protesting, and occupying with no one leading the way. This is baffling to me, but I do understand how they are doing it. As most of these articles share the same overlying topics, Occupy Wall Street is a great example of how the removal of physical barriers helped a cause. Anyone can see what they are doing, anyone can join, anyone can help make decisions, it’s all up to you. What do you want to do?"

      "body": "Citation Jeffries, R., Desurvire, H.W.: Usability Testing vs. Heuristic Evaluation: Was There a Contest? ACM SIGCHI Bulletin, 24(4), 39-41 (1992) Purpose This article focuses on why usability testing is still needed. Recently, many people have been trying to say usability testing is not needed anymore due to the fact that heuristic evaluation (inspection method) can find problems quicker and cheaper when compared together. This article’s goal is to provide valid information on why usability testing is still needed. Methods This paper is a combination of much of the authors previous work. They are trying to show people, who have misunderstood their research, what they are actually trying to say, not what others think they are trying to say. They combine articles they have written as well as collect information from people who have interpreted their research incorrectly. Main Findings They found people are interpreting their previous research incorrectly. The authors wonder why people are trying to discount usability testing, and why people think only one evaluation technique is needed. They argue heuristic evaluation, cognitive walk-through, etc. are all good and well, but under no circumstances should they be the only thing. They then go on to list some results from heuristic evaluation and usability tests, and the results are as expected. The heuristic evaluations found some errors the usability tests missed and vice versa. The other fact they bring up is all the heuristic evaluation were conducted by experts, meaning they knew what to look for. The experts did an expert job (see what I did there) while less capable evaluators missed a lot and did not do favorably. This makes an even stronger case for why usability testing should be used; no experts needed. Analysis I overall liked this article. I know it may not be a full blown research article, but it combines facts from many previously published articles. It seems evident to me usability testing is a must, or at least a try very hard to get done. Lastly, the authors state that more that one validation technique should be used, and I agree with them. Can every error be found by one person going through/using one site/product? I think not."

While this chapter highlights all of the things we talked about, I ended up learning a little more which will be useful in our upcoming assignment. I liked how they relate everything we do, as UX/UI designers, to frameworks. They provided steps on how to do this, which I will not go over here, but I would suggest you take a look at if you are going through this process. The thing I didn’t know was the different types of testing that can be conducted to validate your design. I though it was pretty self-explanatory, usability testing. What I didn’t know was when to do it, or what type of testing to do at different stages of the process. Cooper (2007) states there are two different forms of evaluation: I personally feel formative evaluations are better. Cooper (2007) states that it is a way to get inside your user’s mind; to see if you are doing everything correctly. This seems like it would be more valuable than summative evaluations. Like really? Who wants to try and fix something that is already completed? This chapter builds on Cooper (2007, Ch 7) very much. It basically says the same thing, yet starts with prototyping. I sit here writing wondering why? Isn’t a prototype what comes from the process of requirements to design. I would have though it would have been introduced later. Cooper (2007) didn’t focus too much, at all, on prototyping, but I understood a prototype the the product of the process, as design is an iterative process. I thought it was pretty cool how this chapter showed a table comparing high-fidelity and low-fidelity prototyping, which I put below. I think low-fidelity is the way to go, since there is not a lot of work required and countless ideas can be generated from these. I especially like storyboarding and wireframes. This is all going to be very useful when my group is working on our second project. I found everything useful and would recommend reading Cooper’s About Face if you want more information."

Isn’t the most common way of tightening and loosening things follow the convention “lefty loosy, righty tighty?” In this case no, the sinks decided to pull a fast one on me and reverse how I think. In this case I had to turn the knob right to turn on the water and left to turn it off. Does that make sense to anyone? Not me, I am set in my ways of thinking about this at this point in time of my life. I am trying to relate this back to Gestalt principles (source does a good job of explaining them, but is missing a few and needs a design overhaul) and Jakob Nielsen’s usability heuristics, but it hard because this doesn’t have to do with the web (mostly counts out Nielsen). I count out Nielsen, but his idea of consistency and standards is what this sink violates. The standard is right to tighten, left to loosen, and this violates it.  "

Apple’s website has always been innovative as well as ahead of the curve. Sounds familiar, as Apple as a whole is like this. Just look at the home page. Simple, elegant, and conveys just the right amount of information. I especially like their use of colors, or should I say lack of colors seeing as Apple uses white a lot, and they are really good at it. Apple also does a great job of how it displays information; imagery. Every product Apple produces has an “Image” and this is what they use to link to it on their site. They only display what you really “need” to see and nothing else. I think it is a great thing. I am going to work more on expanding this post over the next couple weeks since there are so many things I like about the Apple site."

I think I maybe buying this book in the near future. How is information organized these day? Chronologically? By date? By length? Is that really what we should be doing? The answer is NO. We have entered the digital age and nothing needs to be ordered. They why do so many programs, like iTunes,  do this you might ask? We are organizing information according to the physical world we live in, where there IS a set of criteria we abide by. Take for example dishes. We sort them by type, stack them depending on this too. We do this without even realizing because we’ve been trained by our parents to do it that way. Why do we have to adhere to the physical world in the digital world? There is nothing holding us back so it doesn’t make sense. We need to start getting over how we think there is a “correct” way to organize things. In the digital world the possibilities are limitless, literally. Some contend it’s better to have something in multiple places simultaneously, rather than having a specific place for an item. I would tend to agree with that. In Everything is Miscellaneous they use Staples as an example. When toner/ink catalogs were split from one large catalog to brand specific catalogs and placed next to their brand, they were used almost 3x as much. Take a look at Flickr for example. How do they sort all their pictures? I can tell you for sure they don’t spend time looking at each picture and categorizing it, like, for example, a librarian cataloging physical books. Flickr puts that job on your shoulder (as well as every other Flikr user) by letting you add tags of whatever you want to any picture. An overarching schema then can be seen, but it is an ever-changing way schema. Not really organizing anything huh? That’s the point. I tried to stay away from just summarizing the reading, but I need to at least share what Weinberger says the three orders of order are: 3 is what makes this “new” form of organization possible. I think this way of thinking is awesome. I can’t wait to see the direction things go in the next couple years as this becomes more apparent to everyone. More to come as I read the rest"

We are now the people who determine how information is organized, instead of one person who determines organization for the rest of us. Organization, in the past, was defined by physical limitations, yet in the digital age those are removed from the equation. Now, the same item can be in two places at once. Take for example books. A specific book can only be in one place. In the digital world, that book can be in any number of places at the same time. Pretty cool huh? Tagging is one of the things done today helping people organize information. This can be seen on Flickr, where tags are generated by a user (can be whatever they want), which will form an organization later. This is a bottom-up process, instead of top-down processes that are used in the physical world.

So now that I’m done pointing out which websites I think are awesome (hint hint, go check them out), I can finally get to the start of talking about Skrillex. Skrillex released his official video of First of the Year (embedded below) a few weeks ago. When did dubstep artists start making music videos? No clue, but this video makes me feel like they should keep on not making them. As you watch this music video, you find out how a petafile get’s tricked by a little girl. As the video plays, you think the man is going to get the little girl, but instead gets throughly surprised when she turns out to be a demon. In the end the girl wins and you see how many people she has done this too. While I like the song, is this really a good message to be sending to impressionable people? I don’t care at my age, but I could see how parents and various other people would. Maybe dubstep should keep to music and skimp on the videos like they have been doing for so long."

Enough about that, I’m here to talk about how much Outlook sucks. I want to point out one, and only one thing Outlook violates in relation to design and heuristics, because it pisses me off more than anything. I can never change any settings when I need to configure different accounts or anything that goes along with that. It never works. Everything is so complicated I just give up (quitters never win, and winners never quit; oh well). I feel the thing I hated most was changing my preferences for specific email accounts. I go to the point where I would never really know what email account I was trying to change, which settings had been saved, and if I’d actually accomplished anything while doing this. This violates Nielsen’s usability heuristic relating to flexibility and efficiency of use. Outlook is anything but flexible. You do something Outlook’s way or you don’t do it at all. Efficiency goes out the window when you initially open the application. I cannot describe in words how mad I have gotten from using Outlook, and how long I’ve sat in front of the computer trying to remedy a problem. Cheers to you Microsoft, you made another horrible product."

This week we focused on the part of going from design requirements to wireframes. After being divided into groups, we were given design requirements and were tasked with creating wireframes detailing the steps required to accomplish a process. By this, I mean we had to design an app where we could accomplish the goal of ordering pizza, but we had to incorporate requirements into this design. My group went about it in the most simplistic way possible. How many screens are actually needed? Can we cut something out here? Is there a way to eliminate a screen in anyway? There are just some of the questions that went through my head when we were creating our interface/wireframe, which you can check out below. Thank you Eddy for the picture. After completing this activity, I looked back on what we actually accomplished. It was amazing what we actually did and getting voted the best design was pretty cool too. We started from nothing; just a blank whiteboard. We actually had to make decisions based on design requirements, which I was really confused about before. For example our home screen includes only two links: deals and order pizza. This was made this way because we had to have a deals section on our app. We also used the requirements in various other parts of the design, but those will not be detailed here. Lastly, I liked how we used whiteboards. It really helped with changes needed throughout this process. I would recommend using low-fidelity stuff more than high just because of the ease when making changes. Overall this was a cool exercise. We were able to take requirements and turn them into a design. While the requirements don’t determine every screen on the interface, there is still a good amount of thinking required to make a good interaction design."

Klout is a website that tries to measure your online influence based on the interactions you have over the different networks you connect. I was really into Klout, like really into it. I would do things trying to raise my score, yet for some reason after a certain point my score plateaued. I started to work harder at it, to no avail. We then talked about Klout in my social media class and how what it is “actually” doing. We were able to relate Klout to the very basics of marketing and advertising. Marketers are able to see the topics you influence people about and through that they can offer different perks. This is in hope that you use them and then somehow spread more information about them. Basically using you to advertise for themselves. Pretty smart huh? I recently read an article on Work Smart Lifestyle comparing social media influence (aka Klout) vs. online reputation. I was changed. I realized it didn’t matter to me how many people I influence, it only mattered that I was seen as a reputable source of information. After thinking about it more, I realized I am really only interested in building a great online reputation. I plan on working to create a good online reputation by posting relevant information to my field, tutorials, and general examples of things I have found that work well and those that don’t. If my information is transmitted to the masses, great, but that is only going to be an added bonus. To see how ridiculous Klout has made things, check out this video. A professor based grades on Klout scores and also says berating students because of low score is acceptable. I would tend to disagree."

Yes, I am a Mac user and for those of you who don’t know what OS X 10.7 is, it is the operating system Lion, Apple’s newest operating system. While Lion came out a while ago, July ’11, I was skeptical of switching because of some of the quirks and issues I had heard about. I finally gave in and upgraded about a week ago, and I have had no problems since. I do admit Mission Control is a little weird for me, as I used spaces a lot. Oh well, I have to get used to something new, not like that’s happened before. After upgrading, I found Lion to be great in use as well as design. A lot of applications have changed drastically from what they were before, but the program I noticed the biggest change with was Apple Mail. It seems like they did a complete overhaul on it. While I love the new way of viewing emails (on the side rather than bottom), I want to point out how Apple follows Jakob Nielsen’s usability heuristic of aesthetic and minimalist design. After looking at the screenshot I provided above, you too can probably realize the minimalist approach Apple took when designing this product. They use icons to their advantage here the most, which are used to accomplish all the main tasks in Mail. Although there is no text by the icons letting you know which one does what, the icons used are so universal that almost anyone clicking them has an idea about what they do. I like this approach and am glad they chose to go this way. Apple also is the king of making things work well and look good at the same time, or as others may put it, the aesthetic part of everything. Mail is a great of example of how aesthetics are used in a program that is able to do so many complex things. They tend to use white and gray a lot in order to make things look good, and I feel they actually accomplished this in Apple Mail. Even with the inbox drawer open on the left hand side, Mail still looks pretty good. It looks more modern and very simple with the drawer closed as well. Overall, I am impressed with the new Lion operating system. I feel Apple has done a great job at making their design better through taking a minimalist approach, which also makes it look better as well. I cannot wait to see what else Apple comes up with in the future."

Traditional hardware and software measures seem to mislead and are inadequate. They propose looking at end-user experience, which will hopefully provide more meaningful benchmark measures of quality of service. This was designed to emulate real users, but in actuality no real users were involved. Methods They created a “bot” using Java, which accessed varied sites on the internet (local and worldwide). They looked at the load time and network delay when accessing these site. Researchers used the local sites as a control group, because there is virtually no load time and no network delay. The specifically looked at online retail sites, search engines, and directory services. Main Findings Results indicated that availability was at 99% for these sites, when local and short-term network errors were removed (81% before these were removed). The found that local availability had the largest effect on user experience. They also found when retry occurred (reloading the page) that non-local errors fell by 83%.  They detail further research that could be conducted in order to help create benchmarks and test suites. Analysis I feel this is relevant to me, as I design sites and try to eliminate the load time (availability) of my sites. In my experience, most users get fed up with a site loading to long, and even Nielsen (if I remember correctly) stated that users will only wait, on average, 3 seconds for a site to load. They also mention retrying, and I am glad to find that errors fall when the page is reloaded. Sometimes a page may not load everything, or code interacts the wrong way with other code, and the only way to fix it is to reload the page."

The all around look and feel are much better, in addition to the improved search and application functionality. I feel this new design (below) follows many of Nielsen’s usability heuristics. The one I like the most, basically because it looks better than before, is how Gmail displays the system status to users. In the screenshot below, this is the pale yellow box at the top. Every time a user does something (delete/send/draft a message) this bar will pop up and let you know exactly what you did, and it even gives you the option to undo that action (this actually relates to Nielsen’s flexibility and ease of use heuristic).

The one that stands out to me as a bad design is when the information architecture is based on the organizational structure of the company. That does not make sense to me. Why would someone organize based on positions? Do those positions do a lot of things, some of which may not even be under their specified department. The actual architecture of the site can be organized by a typology. Some of which include: linear, hybrid, etc. The excerpt below describes these very well. The one I had a problem with when the site navigation (link structure) is set up as an arbitrary network. I do understand that people may start out with one page and continually add different things, but isn’t there some thinking when people construct these? I liked how the two research articles were about top-down organization and bottom-up organization. In class we related this to taxonomy v. folksonomy respectively. We went even further to say that top-down is when the organization decides the information architecture and bottom-up is when the users decide. This really brought it all together for me, as we talked about this last week in my social internet class. Lastly, an information architecture can be set up relating to breadth v. depth. Breadth seems to be the better of the two (from the authors) for various reasons. Some of them include: the user is initially closer to their end goal and if the information architecture is too deep, then it might not make sense to people. This makes it easier to lose people when they traverse navigation. So how do we decide what to use. Well we use our personas, scenarios, use cases, and design requirements. An information architecture should emerge from these, yet it may be hard to decide which one is the right one to use. I am experiencing this in a project I am doing right now for this class involving nanoHUB. Relating the navigation/information architecture using topics from personas, tasks from use cases, etc"

Purdue’s version of Blackboard is a knock-off of the real Blackboard being used at universities around the US, maybe even yours, and has its own set of problems. During my college career, Blackboard has had a slew of problems. PDF’s don’t load. Grades cannot be seen. Professors don’t know how to use it. You name it, it happened. Aside from these issues, it is also very unappealing to look at. I posted a screenshot of the home screen you are brought to after you login. After looking at it you may say, “wow. It looks horrible.” I was along the same lines, thinking it was so horrible that I didn’t even like using it because it bores me. The way they get you to use this site is by serving course content. Who would have thought? A school forcing students to use a bad online program? Never. While it has its technical problems, I want to highlight how the “Help” section of the site really doesn’t help in anyway and the site is not aesthetically pleasing. These two problems address two of Nielsen’s ten recommended usability heuristics. These are the help and documentation and aesthetic and minimalist design heuristics."

      "body": "Last week, we examine the idea of collaboration and communication relative to the social media world. In class we were divided up into two different groups, one representing social software and the other representing groupware. We were then told to identify what each of these are and their characteristics, and came up with the following ideas. Groupware is a tool used to assist groups of users to achieve a goal, whether that goal be communication, coordination, or collaboration. While we are in the Web 2.0 age, groupware was formed well before Web 2.0, Web 1.0 if you prefer to call it. It seems to be “we” focused, as in “we need to accomplish a task.” Some examples of there programs include MS Exchange, email, calendars, etc. Groupware is implemented from the top-down, meaning it is the organization who imposes it on the workers. This is usually for productivity reasons, but other reasons could be involved, such as, “my boss wants to make my life harder” or “the company thinks it’s good for the company” just to name a few (Hopefully you caught my Better Off Ted reference). Social Software, on-the-other-hand, is software or services that support, extend, or derive added value from human social behavior. Some of these sites include Facebook (obviously) and various other social-network[ing] sites. Social software emerged after Web 2.0 and is focused on participation more than collaboration. It has the opposite view of groupware, as it is seen as “me” focused and focused primarily on content. So now the real question, is groupware a part of social software or vice versa? I would tend to say that social software emerged from groupware. Web 1.0 to Web 2.0. Communication with co-workers to communication with everyone. Other evolutions can be seen if you look into it further, but those are the main two which help to prove my point (very scientific huh?)."

The second purpose of this study was to to develop a methodology for studying the Web and other information (involves instrumentation and intensive tasks). Methods Researchers collected data from 14 students at Stanford University, all of whom indicated using the Web daily. Participants were then informed about the study and conducted practice exercises helping them get used to talking aloud while using the Web.

Data was collected using WebLogger (tracks everything the user does), eye tracking software, and videotape. Main Findings The researchers found five main points from their research Analysis This article seems to be very in-depth about how information scent plays a role in the finding of relevant information. It helps me to understand that information scent in crucial when developing sites and applications for the web (and everything else in that case).

Wait, what was I talking about? Oh yeah, we get distracted much more easily these days. The Internet seems to disperse information to us in a fast stream, and thus we have changed to read the same way, fast. We are going from being able to read long articles, books, etc. to only skimming text and looking for information that is pertinent to us. This is emphasized in the article Is Google Making Us Stupid written by Nicholas Carr. This is actually changing the way we THINK. If you want to know more about it, I would suggest reading Carr’s article. I can totally relate to this. I used to read books with ease. Some of which included Harry Potter, Dan Brown, Chuck Palahniuk, and many more. Now I get the pleasure of mostly reading only research articles online. When reading research articles I usually only want to find information about the stuff at the end, which means I usually skip most of it. Skimming at it’s finest I would call it. I recently bought Steve Jobs, by Walter Issacson. When I sat down to read it, I noticed myself thinking about other things. I was getting distracted easily. It could have been the fact I was taking a break from writing two papers simultaneously for the next day, or it could have been how I had been reading over the past couple months (research papers mostly again). I was very surprised because I didn’t actually realize it until now, looking back. Weird huh? It’s amazing how attention works. I am writing an article on Attention now and will be posting the link sooner than later. Don’t get too distracted!"

      "body": "So now that I got the joke out of the way, what is attention? Are there different types? It just so happens there are different types of attention. Top-down attention relates to how one (you) focus. It is what your brain in wanting to pay attention to. Opposite of this is bottom-up attention, which is when something unexpected get’s your attention. BAMMM! (got your attention, maybe before you even started reading this article). In addition to these two types of attention there are three ways we, as humans, process “things.” First, when we process only one thing at a time it’s called serial processing. Parallel processing is exactly what it sounds like, processing multiple things at a time. While these are two basic ways of processing, the one that really stuck out to me is called Automaticity Theory. This theory states that we can only process two things at the same time if one of them is a very automatic task. Interesting huh? That might be why I can’t drive and do homework at the same time. Posner presents a different attention topology (types of attention). I put them in bullets below because it’s pretty simple. So now that you know all about attention, how do we process that information and how much information is too much. The Limited Capacity Model describes the latter perfectly. Here are the stages: Throughout this process breakdown can be experienced at anytime. If too much information is presented in a defined space, then step 2 could fail. There are so many different ways, can you think of any? I figure this is a long enough blog post, so I will just touch base on one last thing, Flow. Flow is the state where you are engrossed in something; it has your total attention and you seem to lose track of time. It seems to be related to how much a person enjoys their life. Take me, for example. I am a web developer. Various times I have sat down at my computer to work on one of my side projects, and the next time I look at the clock it is six or so hours later. I didn’t eat, sleep, stray from my task, or even get up. I was in the zone. This is Flow, a central concept in positive psychology."

While Reddit is a great site, something needs to be said about their design.

Retrieved from http://www.emeraldinsight.com/10.1108/02640479910330714 Purpose This study addresses how information architectures affect the ability of individuals to navigate a site. The site they used was the Dalhousie University’s Web Site, and it was selected because it had previously received awards for design and it had a limited number of options for navigating the site. Methods Twenty-four participants accessed the University’s website over a period of eight days. They were given packets of questions relating to the website and were asked to spend no more than three minutes on each question (one question per page). Once they completed all the questions they were interviewed by the researchers about their experiences. Main Findings The performance of the participants when asked to accomplish tasks on this website was overall poor. Researchers indicated that the tasks were not hard and should have been easy to accomplish. Participants usually spent more time looking for an answer than the time would allow. Users seemed to be confused by the categories and their label. Menu labels did not describe the content it linked to well enough. When users did not see the words they expected, it added to their confusion. Analysis Overall it seemed that it was hard to find information on this academic site. It seems that the information was not organized for a student, and may have been only organized for a teacher/faculty/administration. This is very important and we are studying it now, with our research involving nanaHUB. This article helps me to realize a structure usable by everyone is needed, especially at the scale of university websites."

For purposes of this example, lets say there is more text in the left div, so it’s height is bigger than the right div. If you are having trouble visualizing this structure take a look at the image above. CSS HTML As is, you have “Extra text…” right below the right div (most likely next to the left div), but you really want it after the container. Now, how do we fix that? There are two ways to do this, using clear:both and CSS Clearfix Using clear:both; This method works well, but involves you adding extra, unneeded tags to your markup. To use this method, something like needs to be placed after the right div, from the example above. Note: The element the style is attached to cannot be a . A company I interviewed with for an internship actually asked why I used this method. At the time, I didn’t know about CSS clearfix, and I was using a bunch of extra tags that were unnecessary. Unfortunately the company decided not to have an internship program. Darn! Using CSS Clearfix Using CSS Clearfix to solve this problem is pretty easy. The following styles need to be included in your stylesheet before we can begin. Once this has been included in your stylesheet, the only thing left to do is give the container the clearfix class we just created, which looks like this: This will solve the problem without having any extra tags in it. Pretty cool huh? I have only encountered one quirk using this method over the 2 years I have been using it. Sometimes when the container needs to be centered (margin:0 auto;), display:inline-block; needs to be removed, or else it won’t be centered. That’s a basic introduction to CSS clearfix, hopefully it’s as useful to you as it has been to me."

Methods Data was collected, using the Twitter API, from the public timeline throughout the duration of the four events. National convention tweets were collected over a period of a week, and tweets, relating to hurricane Ike and Gustav, were collected over ten and thirteen days respectively. Tweets were then analyzed based on content and hashtags. Main Findings Results indicated the highest number of tweets for each convention was on the day it happened, not day’s prior and after the event. Hurricane tweets were the highest on the days the hurricanes hit land. Through data analysis the researchers found the inclusion of URL’s was increasing, and there were fewer directed tweets, which include “@”, during these events when compared with the general pool. Their findings lead them to believe “that technology adoption seems to be correlated to the occurrence of crisis and mass convergence events” (Hughes & Palen, 2009). Analysis It is good to know how people view events, and what happens on microblogging sites when these events happen. I think a similar study could be done these days on the issue of Occupy Wall Street. It is pretty evident the number of tweets was highest on the day of the event, but are those tweets really relaying information or are they just there?

They also found the highest motive for non-use of these sites was that people did not have a desire to use them. In regards to the age of users versus non-users, they found users were typically younger than non-users. Lastly, social motives were identified as the uses and gratifications of friend-networking sites. Analysis It is important to know why people use different things, and why that might change over time. My research for TECH 621, being conducted right now, is attempting to answer some of these questions, and this is a great article to supplement that."

      "body": "School finally ended for the semester, which means instead of reading what was assigned to me, I got to choose something I actually wanted to read. I chose to read Steve Jobs by Walter Issacson, and let me say, it was great. I always admired Jobs, yet I had little understanding of who he was, as did most people. I found out a lot more about him after reading his biography, obviously. After reading the first couple chapters I realized Jobs was, to put it lightly, an asshole. Almost everything he does is rude, mean, self-centered, etc. Why was he like this? There’s two reasons. First, it was just who he was. Second, he was very particular about who worked for Apple. His main “thing” was to only hire “A-players,” and it worked. He hired the best people, who only wanted to work with the best people. Jobs also knew he could push people to do their best work. Most of the time when he was rude and/or mean,  he was trying to get his employees to do their best work. This ultimately didn’t work out in the beginning, and lead to him being ousted from the company he created. So how did someone like this make Apple into what it is today? Passion for products and striving to be the best. That is how he did it. While other companies, Microsoft eh hem, focused primarily on software licensing, Apple focused on end-to-end integration of hardware and software. These, coupled with the creation of the iPod and “A-players,” saved Apple, and turned it into the company it is today (which is trading at over $400). I am still amazed with what Jobs accomplished in his life, and if  you want to know more about it I would highly recommend reading this book. After finishing this book, one quote stuck out to me. “The reward is in the journey.” Is it? Think about some big event in your life. I’m thinking about graduating college. Yes I graduated college, and yes I got a degree, which will get me a job. Great. Looking back on my 4-5 years prior to graduating I realize all the things I have been a part of leading to graduation. I made life-long friends, I learned skills that will help me later in life, I was taken out of my comfort zone, etc. All of these things are a greater reward for me than Purdue University actually giving me my diploma. Obviously, I would say, “Yes, the reward is in the journey.”"

For our first assignment our class had to come up with a branding strategy for a client. While I am not an expert in branding, this was just my first attempt, and hopefully I will be getting better as this class progresses. Our client was an architect focused on starting his own firm up in northern Michigan (Arcadia). Over a couple weeks our class had the opportunity to talk with him to get a “feel” for what he was looking for. We then compiled a list of what was important to him. I came up with the following: These just happen to be what the brand was focused on, or the desired perceptions that his company wants to portray to their customers After identifying what our client wanted to stand for, we got into the branding strategy. This should be long and tough right? Nah, the strategy I came up with is relatively simple and is “Quality design which compliments the surrounding environment.” I really wanted to focus on the environmental aspect of the brand, since I’m from Michigan as well and realize Michiganders love the environment. This then leads into my positioning statement, or how the company should position itself relative to its competitors. This statement was “The Arcadia Studio is an architecture firm, always providing quality work and specializing in environmentally friendly designs in northern Michigan.” Pretty simple right? Since my branding strategy focused primarily on the environment, I tried my best to include something of the sort in my mark/logo for the company, which is below. It took me FOR-EV-ER (anyone get the Sandlot reference?) to make this version of the logo. Some of the stuff I came up with first was awful, but after the various revisions this was finally possible. Going through this process definitely made me appreciate designers more and more. This stuff was hard. I would like to thank all the other students in my class for giving me the ideas and constructive criticism to make this final logo possible. These are just some of the other deliverables I made for this project. Nothing too fancy, but good stuff that is usually made when doing branding."

I’m not going to get into all the research right now, but in a later blog post I will be explaining my thesis. Anyway, one of the things I had to measure was an individuals Communication Apprehension Score. This is defined by McCroskey (1977) and is an “individual’s level of fear or anxiety associated with either real or anticipated communication with another person or persons.” In order to get this score, students needed to take a test, consisting of 24 questions. Since this test was just an HTML page and needed to be printed out in order to complete, I thought it would be cool to make it into a website. Hopefully this would make it easier for students to complete (and it did). I created the web application using PHP, XHTML, and CSS3. The source code can also be found on my Github page. It should be pretty easy to integrate into a website, but if there are any questions (probably won’t be) just post them here and I will get on it."

I posted previously about the branding I did for the Arcadia Studio, but now I get to write about something much more exciting, MY BRAND. I’m basically going to go over 3 things: I am a web developer. I love to travel. I love creating things. I love new experiences. I enjoy meeting people. I like new situations, even if they are outside my comfort zone. I am web developer that has a life (trying not to stereotype too much here, but it’s hard). I wanted to incorporate these different aspects of me into my brand, but I honestly had no idea where to start. Our class started out by determining our position statement, or how we want to position ourselves in our chosen field. My positioning statement ended up being, “As a web developer my free time consist of continually learning up-and-coming technologies, which help me create unique easy-to-use web applications that offer the best possible interactive experience and give me something to be proud of.” This only speaks to what I like to do relating to my job, not the other things I enjoy. I knew, somehow, I had to incorporate the others into my brand. Below are some of the concepts I came up with during my first round of ideation. I was told the first one looks like it would go on a wine label. Good thought if I ever make my own wine. The middle logo screams A/V, which means what? Audio/Visual. Great initials huh? With the comments from my fellow students in mind, I chose to work more on the last logo (far right). After much more work (and a little frustration), I created a logo that captures the two, differing aspects that make me who I am (web developer and adventurer). I’ll explain what I was trying to accomplish here. The “Alex” portion represents the adventurer in me. The font is not computer generated (actually my handwriting). The “Vernacchia” portion is computer generated and hopefully helps represent me in a more professional way. Finally, my first name hooks onto my last name, intertwining the two. Kind of like Yin and Yang now that I think about it. This branding will show up on my new website, which I am working on now. Can’t wait to get it done!"

In general, since people can spoof user-agent strings, it really doesn’t matter where you put the detection (could be some specific use cases where one applies). In the end, people are going to see what they want to see when it comes to this stuff. I choose to do it client-side and was all ready to make my own “function” to do this, but then I stumbled over platform.js. It’s a lightweight (11KB minified, and ~5KB gzipped) JS library solely dedicated to browser detection, and let me tell you, it is really good at it. It can be used almost everywhere, I suggest checking out their github README for more info. Platform.js is made by the people who make lodash, the underscore.js replacement (kinda, sort of). Needless to say, they know what they’re doing. It’s super simple to use, automatically detects your browser, and can be used to parse user-agent strings. Just take a look: Or you can parse user-agent strings: It just so happens that I had to do this too. There are ways to do this without a JS library, but using platform.js made my life a little easier. Getting the necessary info for this is as easy as using platform.description or platform.toString(). You’ll get something like this for the description: It’s as simple as searching the string with a regex. Mine looks something like this: So it’s pretty much as simple as that.

NOTE: I am not a SysAdmin and do not have a lot of details on the inner workings of everything in this post. These are just genearl things that worked for me and my set up. I use a Linux box, PHP, Apache, and MySQL in most of my set up. So I insist that you do your research before doing anything haphazardly. The first thing I found was that mysql (mysqld) was taking up huge amounts of memory (RES). So I dived into this first. I started by googling what could be done, and found an article about tuning MySQL performance. I ran the perl file and found out that I had some issues. To remedy this I took a look at a post on stack overflow (which I can’t find again, damn), where the person had a configuration that was pretty close to mine. After making some changes to the mysql my.cnf file and optimizing my tables, I restarted MySQL and waited 24 hours. WOW, what a change. I saw a significant drop in memory usage, but will continue to monitor it as it can be fine tuned even more. On to the next one. Apache seemed to be my next culprit. There were a lot of concurrent processes averaging around 50M each. Gigantic waste of memory, let me tell you. After investigating my options, it looked like I was going to switch from the prefork configuration to the worker configuration. Something about threaded processes and everything. But with this configuration, PHP is unable to do threading by default with apache, or something like that. After looking around I found an article that went through the process step by step to enable PHP use with mpm_worker. It was actually painless, and boy did this cut down on the memory apache was using. Like DAMN, that’s a huge improvement. I would recommend taking a look at doing that. My blog is ran on WordPress 3, and that in itself is a huge memory waster (WordPress that is). After digging into some things that could increase WordPress’ performance I found that permalink structure can affect the loading of your blog. The error lies in the rewrite.php file or so I’m told, but I changed my permalink structure to include the post id, which made my posts easier to retrieve by the WordPress engine. Boy do I hate wordpress, but I just don’t have time to switch over. Right now I don’t cache anything in WordPress either, but I will be looking into that for sure. So those were some of my problems. Remember, I just manage my own server and do not have a super in-depth knowledge of this performance stuff. I’m doing what works out for me. Research before you think of trying these things out."

Everything loads correctly in the browser, so why isn't it loading in my build process!! After a few hours of toiling, and staying up way past my bedtime, I finially thought that it could be something with RequireJS. Lo and behold, I found this. It DOES NOT work with the version of Require I was using. Long story short, downgraded to Require v2.0.2 for my tests (can use up to v2.0.6 and it will still work), and now grunt, qunit, and require all play nice. I swear I almost pulled out my hair on this one."

      "body": "I finally made my first open source contribution that I am proud of. Well not my first contribution and I'm proud of most of my work, but this was the first \"real\" one for me. At ExactTarget (where I work) we use FuelUX for our front-end components. FuelUX extends Bootstrap, adding UI components that I/we use in our everyday development. While I was working on a project something frustrated me. It frustrated me so much I knew I needed to do something. So I forked our repo and went to work. ...is that Bootstrap's dropdown menus always display themselves below the clicked element. When an element is positioned near the bottom of the page or the dropdown is too big, it will run off the page. For our datagrid this is a HUGE problem (since most of them are stretched to the bottom of the page). To combat this \"problem\" I created a javascript file that highjacks the click events on the elements with data-toggle=\"dropdown\". After highjacking the click, it makes a few calculations and will decide where to place the dropdown. My first working-draft made calculations using the window as the containing element. But, what happens when a containing element has an overflow value not set to \"visible\"? Using the window would not work in this case. To fix this, I cycle through the clicked element's parents, choose the closest element whose CSS overflow value is not \"visible,\" and set this to be the container which the calculations are based on. I put the gists below, or you could check it out the FuelUX repo (2.4.0-wip branch). Maybe this will end up in Bootstrap one day. Or, maybe not since Bootstrap 3 will be mobile first. I guess we'll see. NOTE: If the clicked element's parent's position is set to static this will ALTER the styles. This is because my positioning won't work correctly in this situation so I overwrite it to relative. NOTE 2: This code could probably be cleaned up a little more, but that's for a later time."

      "body": "stress/stres/verb This past summer, my team was tasked with architecting and building a product for ExactTarget's user conference, Connections. Connections is a user conference that ExactTarget holds for its clients, prospects, partners, developers, and employees. A lot more information can be found here. This year, we (ExactTarget) were looking to make waves in the tech scene (you know, since we were recently acquired by salesforce.com). My team started gearing up for this about 3 months prior; the earliest a team has started to prepare for Connections ever. \"We'll have plenty of time,\" I thought to myself. Boy, was I wrong. Two months go by, we have developed 1 1/2 different products. One fully functional app. The 1/2 was prototyping of what our designers/VP thought they wanted. \"Thought\" being the keyword. So we have a month left. It's getting to crunch time. Lo and behold, we get word that we have to start over. We're not using anything that we've created so far. SHIT! I'm sure other people were thinking it also. Technically we didn't have to start from scratch, we just had to move the stuff we had already created to a different URL route. For the most part, we could still use our node server we had been working on that ran our app. With 3 weeks left until the demo, my team did work. We accomplished so much, even with requirements, designs, and functionality changing every few hours. This team was one of the best I've ever been apart of. Our manager let us do what we needed to do in order to deliver everything on time; He even helped with some coding stuff! It was the speediest development cycle I have ever seen. On average, we deployed code every few hours over a 3-week period. Even on weekends. Stackato really helped us accomplish this feat. With the demo a week away, a lot still had to get done. Our VP of Technology was planning on presenting this at our company meeting on Friday. Talk about stress. We get a good amount of done by Thursday, but realize we'll have to stay late to get it done by the company meeting the next day. This is in addition to staying late every other day for the past month, just later this time. It gets to be around 11pm, and we've finished just about everything. We're feeling good. And shit, we just got an email from the lead UX designer with some news. Looks like we have to develop an entirely new navigation scheme/layout. And from the screenshots, it didn't look like it was going to be easy. We get to it, everyone with their individual tasks. 2+ people are working on the new navigation at any one time. Progress. Finally, we finish around 8am. I have just enough time to go home, take a shower, and head back to the office. I was thinking to myself, \"I sure hope this $#$@&!@ works!\" And it did. There were only a few small errors, but my team were the only people that noticed. Everyone else thought it was the coolest thing ever. Tuesday rolls around. We've been making content changes left and right along with a few functional changes. I cannot wait for this to happen (more like be over haha). Everything is set up. The keynote has started. Our VP of Technology takes the stage. It's fucking go time, and all I can do is sit on the edge of my seat and hope everything goes well. It was probably the most nerve-racking time of my life. IT WENT OFF WITHOUT A HITCH!!! I was so proud of my team and what we had accomplished. It turned out to be the best demo in the history of Connections. This was based on attendees and Salesforce's feedback over the next week. Needless to say, I was ecstatic. We had accomplished what we had set out to do. It felt so good; coupled with the fact that I could finally relax and actually had a little more free time. I am extremely glad I was apart of this. Not many developers get the opportunity to develop something of this magnitude and present it to so many people on a main stage. A modified version is being presented at Salesforce's Dreamforce and Connections UK. Such exposure. I consider myself very lucky For all you non-nerds, you could probably stop reading here. For this demo I got to experiment with awesome, bleeding-edge technology. They include: It was sweet, and I cannot wait to continue building it."

      "body": "I searched high and low for a solution to this. Every post I found was so technical about it, so hopefully this makes it easier to understand. I was recently doing some work integrating Strider with a Github Enterprise Server (GHE). I thought it was going to be pretty easy, and boy was I wrong. I started by modifying the node module that the Strider team created to integrate with Github.com. I thought, \"These two are basically the same thing, should be easy to handle\". After integrating the configuration options to specify a GHE server, I was ready to test. I boot up Strider and there's the start page. I login; it works. Everything's going so well. I try to authenticate with our GHE server and see the oAuth page with everything Strider wants to access. Perfect. I click the authenticate button, and am redirect back to my app. Here's where things start to fall apart. I'm greeted by this awesome error message UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE, and I'm thinking to myself, \"WTF!! This works with github.com and the GHE is a copy of that.\" After a few hours of messing around, looking for others who've had this problem, and getting frustrated I asked one of my co-workers. Turns out he was doing something else and ran into this problem. It turns out that our SSL Certificate Chain was not set up correctly. When node makes requests using the https module (require('https')) it automatically inspects the certificate chain. If there's a problem, it will throw this error. Our problem was that we have a root certificate, intermediary certificate, and then the wildcard certificate for our GHE. Turns out the wildcard certificate wasn't linked to the root. And there you have it. In this post I talk about GHE integration and Strider, but not the outcome. I will have a post about that soon. Heres a full version of my lovely error message: I found a workaround for this problem, but it is a potential security risk. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. To work around this you'll need to set rejectUnauthorized = false on whatever is handling your requests. You can usually pass it in with the headers (options) and you should be fine. Again, use at your own risk."

I started by trying to use Disqus' URL Mapper migration tool, but it turned out that you couldn’t migrate comments between sites with different short codes. I guess I set up my stuff wrong, or not the way Disqus suggests. Oh well. So here's what I did, and it was a time consuming task. After you do this, you should see the comments on your Disqus dashboard. Be sure to check the URLs to make sure they match the correct post they should be attached to. To test this, I created a testing site on Disqus and imported the comments there to make sure everything was correct before actually importing them to my actual blog."
